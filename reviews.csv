"I recently purchased a Hewlett Packard Digital Camera that came with a 4 mb flash card.  The Vikings 128 mb flashcard is great.  At Xmas I took 52 pictures and still had 167 pictures available to take on the card.  I recommend this card to anyone who, like myself loves to take pictures."
"The Fujifilm FinePix 1400 Zoom digital still camera is a sleek and handsome device styled with a familiar &quot;point-and-shoot camera&quot; sort of design. Controls are reasonably well laid-out and fairly easy to  handle, even for middle-aged hands and thick fingers like mine.For the  record, this is my first digital camera. I regard myself as an  &quot;intermediate&quot; amateur in 35mm film photography, and desktop  computer operations.Though I have not yet made any prints from the  digital images I have taken with this camera, I am very well satisfied with  the color and sharpness in the daylight macro images taken in my rose  garden as I view them on my iMac. The attempt to photograph my nephews'  graduation from the bleachers of a high school gymnasium, however, revealed  the limitations of the modest built-in flash, and the lens' ability to pick  up &quot;ghosts&quot; of the overhead lighting.The camera can take  pictures in your choice of three quality levels (basic, normal, or fine)  and one of two pixel sizes (640x480 or 1280x960). A 320x240 file size can  accomplished by editing a recorded image using the &quot;resize&quot;  function. Indeed, any larger size can be reduced to a smaller size (to the  minimum 320x240). This can save space on the SmartMedia card, or reduce  transmission time over internet email, for instance.The camera comes  with one 4MB SmartMedia card. According to the owners manual, the  &quot;standard&quot; number of 1280x960 images which can be recorded in 4MB  ranges from 6 &quot;fine&quot; to 12 &quot;normal&quot; to 23  &quot;basic;&quot; and the number of 640x480 images ranges from 23  &quot;fine&quot; to 44 &quot;normal&quot; to 69 &quot;basic&quot;. The  manual goes on to say that actual capacity &quot;varies slightly depending  on the type of subject.&quot;The highly recommended purchase of a 32MB  card increases 1280x960 &quot;standard&quot; capacity to 50  &quot;fine,&quot; 99 &quot;normal,&quot; and 180 &quot;basic&quot; images;  and 640x480 &quot;standard&quot; capacity to 180 &quot;fine,&quot; 330  &quot;normal,&quot; and 496 &quot;basic&quot; images.An indoor flash  picture of a furnished room revealed some barely detectable  &quot;jaggies&quot; along the edges of a lamp shade in the  &quot;normal&quot; mode. Switching to &quot;fine&quot; eliminated these  altogether. (BTW, in a normal-size room, the flash exposure was ample.)I  must agree with the many reviewers who have written that the LCD display is  a bit too small and not bright enough to see easily in full sunlight, but I  have found that a &quot;banker's visor&quot; or &quot;big bubba&quot;  billed cap can help.The optical viewfinder is another solution, and is  especially useful because it actually &quot;zooms&quot; along with the lens  in pseudo-SLR fashion. But unlike a true thru-the-lens viewer, the parallax  error in this camera is significant. Because the &quot;film&quot; does not  &quot;see&quot; exactly the same &quot;frame&quot; as the optical  viewfinder, you might end up cutting off Aunt Mildred's head in that next  photo if you don't take care.The camera manuals, though they still sound  a bit &quot;translated,&quot; are actually very informative, well  organized, and well thought-out. The installation of the software drivers,  and downloading over the USB interface to my iMac with MacOS 8.6 went  without a hitch.Besides a larger SmartMedia card, other recommendable  additions include one (or better yet, two) full sets of rechargeable  batteries with recharger. And, if you plan to spend time using the  in-camera editing features, consider getting the AC adapter,  too.Playback functions include a nice nine-image LCD  &quot;thumbnail&quot; display mode. And those with advanced interests might  want to take advantage of the camera's ability to edit various Digital  Print Order Format (DPOF) settings.My verdict on the Fujifilm FinePix  1400 Zoom is that it is a very good value as an entry-level digital camera  capable (within reasonable limits) of capturing excellent images for  computer viewing. In today's marketplace, there are but two or three that  can directly compete with it for price and features - especially for owners  of USB equipped computers."
"On a tight budget when I purchased my dRebel almost two years ago - this lens looked very attractive. Since owning it for two years - it seems to go further and further to the back of my equipment bag - and not taken in my backpack at all unless the climate is too harsh for my more expensive lenses.In fairness to the product - it is very GOOD for what it cost and how it is designed. It makes no pretension to be anything other than an AF f5.6 >75-300mm&lt; telephoto. The construction has remained solid - the zoom (fairly stiff or tight when new)sometimes makes funny noises from grit lodged in the 'nether regions' of the lens barrel (I am a defense contractor who travels to some pretty rotten climates). Dust and dirt do not seem to be a serious problem with regular maintenance of brush and blower around the rotating parts of the lens barrel.Things I enjoyed with this purchase:1. Light weight, solid construction2. Acceptable optical quality in sunny outdoor use3. Accepts the same filters (58mm) as my dRebel kit lens4. Affordable for those on a tight budget5. Compatible with the dRebel autofocus and auto exposure system6. Expendable (if something bad happens) in harsh climates7. Draws absolutely no attention from customs inspectors, (or anyone looking to steal your stuff) when clearing security at ports of entry or return. Clears airport security without manual inspection.Unsatisfactory/annoying qualities that quickly became evident:1. f4-5.6 limited my use indoors or low light. Plan to spend much time in Photoshop to save your pictures2. Length of lens made it unusable with the dRebel pop-up flash (lens shadow). Immediate purchase of a 420EX Speedlight ($177+ see my review) cured this problem3. Front focus rotating lens element limited my filter choices to UV (haze) filter only4. Annoyingly SLOW auto focus5. Tripod is almost manditory with lower shutter speeds (see f4- 5.6 limits). The 1.6x magnification factor when seated to the dRebel brings the focal length out to over 450mm making off tripod use risky* Use of a BGE-1 battery grip ($100+ see my review) with this lens - lowers camera center of gravity-extra counter-weight makes lens use less stressful.Good price - fair optics - limited overall performance. Limits for the serious photographer make one want to look elsewhere. SIGMA has superior product in this price category, as well as the house brand at Ritz/Wolf Camera chains-while the discriminating photographer who has the resources should look seriously at Canon's ""L"" series (as I've done) or 'IS' series as suggested by other experienced reviewers."
"My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card. Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.Three things make this camera a particularly good buy:First, and most importantly, its size makes it SO CONVENIENT. I have had absolutely no qualms dropping the S100 in a bag or pocket and walking out to a birthday party, a sports event, or whatever--space simply isn't an issue with this camera. As a result, I have taken some of the best shots of friends and family with the Canon.Second, the feature set is basic, but very easy to use. The power button is a simple button--no toggle thumb switches with multiple settings that can sometimes be confusing. Switching between viewing and capturing modes is simple and straightforward, and even the more advanced features (such as changing the flash mode) are easy to figure out even without reading the manual.Finally, the &quot;built in&quot; lense cap is a big plus. I didn't realize how nice this &quot;feature&quot; is until I briefly used a friend's digital camera and had to remove and replace the lense cap WITH EVERY SHOT. The built in cap seems insignificant with light use, but when taking many shots over the course of a few hours, the S100 really shines.Photographers should be warned, however, that the S100 is not a professional-level camera by any means. The 2.1 megapixel resolution, while not meager, is not enough to yield even high-quality 5x7's. Serious cropping of a photo is usually out of the question because of the limited resolution.So, if you will be using your camera as a &quot;fun&quot; camera--for casual pictures--look no further. This is the one. If you're serious about picture quality, compare the S100 carefully to its larger siblings--the S20, and the G1.Overall, a fantastic little camera."
"Ive had this camera for 9 months, and I have grown very attached to it. I've beat the crap out of it and it still works fine, a good sign.It fits in ones hand like a crazy optical-recepting hand gun.  After time and experimenting, one grows accustomed to its grip and it's small size makes the human subjects less nervous, almost as if no video camera is there, just a miniscule receptor of their realtime image.If you have a friend with one of these too (Scheeronious), you can firewire the 2 cameras together and do some improvisational editing and recording of footage, easily.infrared night-vison, with &quot;old movie&quot;  to make night shots mystical... overlap fading face-morphing,  Luminscennt effects. Manual exposure adjusting to tweak the lighting, in conjuction with slow-shutter surrealism.  &gt;&gt;&gt; The camera give you a lot of room to play.I use the memory stick all the time to capture stills off my prerecorded footage.  I like the small 640x480 jpegs, its easier to work with in photoshop, transfers quick, save-em-stright-to-floppy or email-em size.  If one really wants high quality pics one has to capture the live still straight to the stick. raltime capture even makes a simulated digital &quot;cli-click&quot; sound of an SLR camera when you hit the photo button.  Sony style at its best.This camera is great on an airplane, to watch all your old movies in-transit, and catch stills off of them.  If you really wanted to, you could easily record tv, movies etc.., and watch it on this camera on the plane almost like a MiniDVD player.Problems: 1. You can't use fader and digital effects at the same time. 2. You can't activate digital effects with the LCD closed. 3. The built-in microphone doesn't pick up low bass frequencies real well. 3. upgrade this camera with a wide angle lens, and extended life battery, and 32 meg stick.  Wide angle is a must, it creates a more immersive viewer experience."
"This lens is intermediately priced, good Macro Lens.This focal length is particularly useful since its 100mm focal length (160mm on APS-C lineup) can achieve reasonable result for both Portrait photography and Macro Photography.With this lens, you can get pretty close to your subject without much of compromise.  Focus is reasonably fast, that is somewhat sufficient to chase small animal if used with camera such as 20D, 30D, 1D MKII.But, if you shoot small creature professionally, you might feel bit awkward at some point as it is very easy to hit limitation of current AF technology, if so, it might be better off switch to MF quickly to chase the subject.  And this lens perform reasonably well on the MF mode as well.But, you really have to use it with full sensor DSLR such as 5D or 1DS series to get your money worth from this lens.  You will love bokeh this lens will create when you shoot with this lens.While it will not match optical performance of EF 180mm f/3.5 L USM Macro Lens  (As it cost nearly 2.5 times) as macro lens, it will certainly focus faster, easy to carry, and It is very sharp and perform well for other function such as for portrait .Of course, I will not say it will match performance of true portrait lens from Canon that sports much wider aperture, but this lens came pretty close, and you can get away with the most of professional assignment with this.I just recently completed photo shoot for some professional magazine article that catered for designer and photographer, and this lens perform superbly along with more expensive L variety lens.  So, this lens is pretty reliable.Some professional pointed vignetting issue at f/2.8, though I did not notice much.  My shooting style does not required to take notice as I tend to stopped down to shoot subject when I am using this lens, but it is possible to be a issue for some people who tend to shoot at wide open.As a Macro Lens, this lens will really shine when stopped down to beyond f/16 or so, as it is true macro lens designed to shine at those f-stop range.This focal length are popular for macro photography, and there are other budget solution from third party manufacture, and few OEM brands that sports Auto Focus mode exist, but they will not match optical performance of EF100 f/2.8 USM Macro Lens as this lens is very nice at almost all f-stop whereas third party solution is tend to be good at particular f-stop .It does not weigh much, so it will not going to be your burden.  When I am on the field, I tend to carry 3 large zoom + one or two fixed focus lens, and this lens will be one of such lens to bring if I have to choose among prime lens.It also makes decent product photography lens, though if you have extra budget, I would go for the TS-E 90mm f/2.8 Tilt-Shift Lens as it is a lens designed for that particular purpose.  But, when you are on the field, and asked to do quick work on the spot, EF 100mm f/2.8 USM Macro will handle job just fine.Pro:Excellent optical performance at all f-stop. And it is suited for number of purpose.  Consider it as utility telephoto prime lens.Good Starter Lens for Macro Photography, and easiest to master compared to other Macro solution offered at the Canon EF system.Con:Hood or Pouch are not included, and you will need them!"
"This is a review for beginners by some one who's still learning. If you're an experienced photographer, just consider the 5 stars and read other reviews.The quality of this lens is great. As many reviewers have pointed out, the image quality is sharp and the colors excellent. This should come as no surprise, macro lenses are usually some of the best lenses made. And of course it focuses all the way to infinity as well, so that you can use it as a ""general purpose"" lens.Depending on what you use the camera for, this is probably not a carry around lens. The 100mm focal length (equivalent to 160mm on APS-C sensor cameras such as 20D) makes it difficult to use it - I find myself having to move back and reposition myself very often, and may result in a missed opportunity.A few other accessories will come in really useful to get consistently good macro photos.- A stable tripod- A remote release cable- External flash- Books about photography, if you don't have them alreadyI have the first, just bought the second, and thinking about the third. Amphoto has some very good books on photography. I find ""Understanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson to be very well written and easy to read.A remote cord will prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter. I've tried using timer mode to compensate for the lack of a remote cable release. The problem with that is that when the timer goes off, the breeze that died down may have picked up again, and my carefully framed flower is now halfway out of the photo, and is blurry as well. I never realized how windy it is in my backyard until I tried taking macro photos of plants.Why a tripod? To achieve maximum depth of field (more areas in sharp focus), you need a small aperture. A small aperture means a slower shutter speed to get a correct exposure. Boosting the ISO too far will result in noise. That means that unless there is a blinding amount of light (this is where the flash comes in) you're unlikely to be able to hold the camera still enough to prevent blurring. The only thing worse about a macro photo with only a small area in sharp focus is a blurred macro photo. And remember, stable is the key word. A cheap shaky tripod may not be much better than no tripod.Speaking of light, try not to take outdoor macro photos (or any outdoor photos) under strong direct sunlight if you can avoid it. You'll find the color washed out compared to an overcast day, or early morning / evening. Or you can use a light diffuser, but that's yet another accessory to carry around.As an alternative to a remote release, you can use a laptop, USB cable and software. It is rather more difficult to carry around, and you can get a 3rd party remote release for around 1/3 the price of the Canon original."
It's just a remote control.  I  wish you can operate the camera from behind
"This indeed is a fine lens. Excellent construction. Relatively small and discreet (with the lens hood off). Excellent image quality and very sharp. The colors it produces are gorgeous - it may be a subjective thing, but to me it has that certain look that you get from some of the finest L lenses. If you buy it, you will be very pleased.The one negative thing I can say about the lens is that it has less than stellar flare control. More than my other lenses, this lens is susceptible to washed out images if the sun is in the wrong spot. It is at times frustrating if you can't work around. It is a bit of an issue, but I wouldn't consider it serious enough that you should avoid this lens for this reason. I would give this lens a 4 1/2 stars, but Amazon forces me to take off a whole star.Once micro-adjusted on you camera, it is very sharp. I used this thing on both 5d mark ii and Rebel T2i. I found that on 2ti, while creating beautiful images, it was always slightly out of focus (evident only when you pixel peeped). On the 5d mk ii on the other hand, it is perfect, but as I said, had to be adjusted. I suspect that my copy needs to be calibrated. Make sure that you test it out if you don't the option to adjust in your camera. This issue can be easily fixed on the 5d mk ii.I don't think it is fair to reduce the rating because the lens a prime or that it is not a zoom and therefore not as versatile. That's the type of lens that it is. If it doesn't suit you, don't buy it. While primes have much better IQ than zooms, I understand that is not the case when it comes to Canon L tele zooms such as 70-200 2.8 ii. In terms of IQ, there would be no advantage to getting this prime. However, the pros of the 200L prime is that it is much smaller, it's black and more discreet and significantly cheaper.Lack of IS is not really an issue on a full frame camera where you can crank up the ISO a bit in lower light situations. At 2.8, this lens is reasonably fast to shoot hand held in daylight. I've used it hand held indoors where there was a lot of light and I had no issues whatsoever.This lens is quite versatile. It's wonderful for portrait and landscape photography. It would make a great sports lens I suppose, but I've never used it for that purpose. If you have kids, this will probably be your go to lens. I doubt that this lens is suitable for wildlife, as it just doesn't reach far enough for that purpose.I have one final suggestion to those contemplating purchasing this lens. I find that I love owning the lens, but I use it the least. Consider if you need this focal length. If your longest lens is a 50mm or 80mm, you may find that a 100mm or 135mm is a more versatile focal length."
"This review about an older camera is to help those who still have their D510, help those who may be looking for a very good used or refurbed older digital as an entry into digital photography without spending alot, and to debunk some of the bunk you will find in comments here due to not reading the full manual on CD. The printed Manual, which would be the one a reader would start with, is close to USELESS. Don't stop with this one. It does not do this great camera justice.First, I have had mine for about 2 years and it is still going strong, even after buying it as a factory refurb. Second, this camera provides the best match on the market between point-and-shoot convenience, small size, and some extended pro's control over resolution, white balance, shutter speed(ISO), focus point, etc. You will have to buy an upscale(read that expensive) camera today to get these options. Third, this camera takes great pictures at just 2.1 Megabit, and you really don't need more  han this if you don't plan to print photos larger than 8 x 10.Now here are tips for using this camera and some for useful for Digital Photography in general:1.The settings you change ARE retained after power off, but you have to SET this option. Open the lense for picture taking, push OK button to enter Setup screen, follow the Manual instructions to change the default settings to what you want, now set the RESET option to HOLD in the SET options screen. Don't forget once set they will be retained until you RESET defaults back to D510's originals, which means if you HOLD defaults to a low resolution say in order to get more pics on the 8Meg mem card supplied, and forget to change it before taking a pic needing higher resolution, you just lost it. This is why D510 is defaulted to HQ, the setting required for photo quality 5x7's.I leave resolution to HQ and use a bigger 64Meg mem card. I change the Digital Zoom default from OFF to ON because so I always get the full range of both Optical and Digital Zoom via the Zoom lever on top. In the ON option, a graphic shows on your LCD in pic taking mode to indicate when you have Zoomed past the Optical(optical does not degrade resolution) and are entering Digital(will begin to reduce resolution of pic). In addition, when you are still in Optical you will here lense motor run. When you are out of Optical and into Digital you will not here motor any longer. Digital zoom only shows in LCD, not Optical View finder, so be sure to frame you shot in the LCD if zooming past the 3X Optical.2. The flash pops up automatically to be sure you don't forget to open it, missing a pic that needed it. To turn it off, just hold down the flash while taking the pic, or use right arrow key to set it to OFF or to set other Flash Options before taking pic.3. BATTERIES. You MUST get 1600 Mah or higher NiMH or NiCAD batteries and charger. ALL digital cameras and toys eat Alkalines and other non-chargeables. Get eight AA so you have a ready set of 4 for backup. You will get great battery life from each recharge, even when using the LCD for viewing your pics and setting(framing) your pic shots. You will not be happy if you don't invest in rechargeables and a larger Memory card.4. You must use an Olympus SmartMedia Card to use the Panorama feature. Since these cost more than generic brands, I use the Olympus 8Meg that came with the camera for Panorama shots and use my generic 64Meg for all others. Note the Digital Panorama is not the same as Analog Panorama. It is not a one shot deal, but more than one shot pieced together in the Cammedia Software supplied. Takes some practice and a MUST READ of the Manual.5. To view your still pics on the LCD push monitor button once, if lense is closed. If lense is open, press twice in quick succession. Press again to quit. To set view/play movie options, close lense and press monitor, then press OK. To set Pic taking options, open lense and press OK. Use arrow keys to navigate to options and OK to set an option change.6. The quality of you pics have as much or more to due with lighting and the stillness at which you hold the camera, than the resolution(mega pixels) you choose. A digital camera takes longer to take a picture than an Analog, and even more time in low light, no flash, zoomed, and high resolutions settings. One could write a book here, and there are some. Read up so you will be happy and not blame the camera for limitations you should be aware of before changing to Digital Photography. The keys one are, in order of priority; frame your shot in the viewfinder when possible with focus frame centered on non-bright area like persons face, not a white shirt, hold the shot button down half way till a green light tells you it has focused. Hold camera very steady 1 sec before and 1 second after pic is taken. Squeeze pic button between index on top and thumb or other finger(s) on bottom of camera. Don't just push on top because like a rifle shot, if you pull the trigger your barrel will move. If you slowly squeeze it, it will not move.More steadiness time is needed for low light, flash OFF, zoomed and high resolution(megapixels) shots. If you pic is somewhat blurry it is likely you and not the camera. Newer digitals have Digital Stabilization to mitigate some movement during pic taking.Finally, the D510 is an awesome and reliable camera. It deserves a 5, but the stupid manual and some un-intuitive menu labeling and navigation has reduced it to a 4. I would highly recommend it as a low cost camera for anyone who wants a digital but don't want to spring for an unknown new one at high cost. You will have to pay over $300 for a camera with the pic taking options and control this one gives you."
