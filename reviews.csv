"(""Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost."",)"

"(""If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music."",)"
"(""This is, by far, the best radio you can buy for AM/FM reception.  The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing.  FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural.  Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners.  There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference.  The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine.  The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter.  The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have.  The antenna is easily replaced if damaged.  It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts.  There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker.  Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale.  The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.**EDIT**  In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III.  Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.  I am listening to the original, reviewed item right now, and I'm glad to see the line is still being produced even if it is under the throwback RCA brand."",)"

"('Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as ""bi-directional"" or ""EPP"". For best results, you should run the ""Parallel Port Accelerator"" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The ""User\'s Manual"" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega ""Copy Machine"" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega ""Format"" function. Use ""Short Format"" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The ""Long Format"" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. ""Write Protection"" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as ""non-removable"" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn\'t work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first (""daisy chaining""). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties\'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics\', then `Close\' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info\' on the `Disk Type\' Note the `Disk Life Status\' and the `Format Life Status\'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format\' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: ""SCSI controllers"", ""Iomega"", ""Iomega Parallel Port Interface"", then ""Finish"".',)"

"(""There are two schools of thought on the use of go-to telescopes.  One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy.  however, I'm a believer in the other viewpoint.  I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone.  I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use.  Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope, I estimate it has performed as desired on 90% of my viewing nights.  Unusually, I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty.  I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX, while a beautiful scope, can be a little temperamental.  Even after doing a quick and rough alignment, like pointing it in the general direction of due North, without using a compass, I still get very accurate results with the autostar.  I even changed locations the other day, moving from Auckland to Taupo, (some 3 hrs travel distance by car) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo.  Suprisingly after alignment, I still got accurate positioning from the autostar.  Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around.  The amount of data is staggering, but given the size of the playground, it's not suprising.  The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark.  I havn't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc.  The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score.  I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod, you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it. Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way.  On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself. These have been far and few between, and readily fixed itself.  Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected.  One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls.  This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating. This however is only a minor niggle. If you have any concerns about your Autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar, Mike Weasners site. The Autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your ETX. Clear skies everyone and happy alignments."",)"

"('I\'ve owned every kind of on-the-head audio device from Koss electrostatics to el-cheapo convenience store earbuds, and I have finally found the perfect mix of style, comfort, value, and sonic accuracy.  It is difficult to believe (unless you\'ve used these Sony\'s yourself) that any headphones can look so cool, be so comfortable, cost so little (relatively), and sound so good.  I listen to jazz, rock, reggae, classical, show tunes - pretty much anything, and no musical genre is shortchanged.  While high and middle notes are reproduced with exceptional quality and accuracy, it is absolutely amazing how well bass notes are rendered.  Listening to the double low C at the beginning of ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" is an experience not to be missed, and is especially remarkable because of the absolute lack of the doubling usually encountered with small diameter (relatively) acoustic transducers.  Breathtaking.  Buy \'em - you\'ll be glad you did.Update:  December 30, 2012Love these headphones, and it looks like I always will, but I have found a way to make them even better. Here is a review I wrote on improving the Sony MDR-V6 headphones:I bought these ear cushionsBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions for DT250, DT280, Sony MDR7506 and V6 Headphones (Pair)for my Sony MDR-V6 phones and could not be happier. The Sony cushions are certainly good, in fact are a cut well above average, but the Beyerdynamic\'s are still a clear step above even them. Wearing the Sony\'s with the original cushions for more than an hour left my ears a bit sore, especially at the very top and bottom where they were slightly pinched. The Beyerdynamics, however, allow me to wear the MDR\'s indefinitely with zero discomfort. I don\'t know if it\'s the slightly larger size of these cushions, or the material they\'re made from, but it\'s like wearing air - you simply don\'t notice their physical presence. And there is an additional benefit: for whatever reason, probably because of the superior seal these cushions make against your head, bass frequencies are enhanced over the already excellent bass produced by the Sony\'s. In fact, to make the expression of bass consistent with mid and high frequencies I found using an equalizer helpful. The lowered requirement for the headphone amp to produce bass frequencies allows it to reserve energy it can then use to support a wider, and more accurate, dynamic range. A win-win situation all because of better ear cushions!In an earlier review I read about how to install the Beyerdynamic ear cushions. Nevertheless, I approached the job with more than a little trepidation, worried that I\'d end up with a pretty but non-functioning pile of junk. Not to worry though, a good tug removed the originals and installing the new was a pretty obvious procedure. Glad I did it! And yes, at least for the Sony headphones, toss the plastic flanges that come in the package. They might be needed for some other headphone model, but not the Sony MDR-V6\'s.',)"
"('First off, my initial impression of this headphone was astonishment. The build quality all the way down to the solid way the headphone clicks into place when you extend each side was superb. Also, the fit was very good, i am 5\'11 with a muscular build, and they cover my ears fine.When i put them on, i immediately noticed how quiet everything was, even with music playing low volume, i couldn\'t even hear myself typing this review on my very loud razer blackwidow keyboard that clicks every time you strike a key.The V6 is an older design (more than 15 years old), and it shows. Persoanlly though, i like the design and the look. It\'s very different from the all-plastic designs common to other inexpensive Sony headphones. The headband is wrapped in pleather, with minimal padding. Length-adjustable metal strips attach the earpieces to the headband. The driver housings are of black metal, a plus. The cups are covered in crinkled pleather. The coiled cord is one meter long at rest, but extends to three, and attaches to the left earpiece. The plug is a mini; the 1/8"" adapter (included) screws on, to prevent accidental extraction. Both plug and adapter are nickel plated, rather than gold like the more expensive MDR 7506 (basically the same headphone with different stickers, gold plating on the jack, and an extended warranty), which is the only visible sign of the V6\'s relatively low price bracket. The V6 folds, in the manner of some of Sony\'s other headphones; that is, the ear pieces swing up under the band, to form a more compact package. After this treatment the V6 fits into the black pleather bag it comes with.Since the range is so large (5hz-30khz) you can hear everything, including the distortion of not well leveled sound. But that\'s whey these were made for the studio, and not really for personal listening. i am really glad that whenever i download songs, i make sure they are 192kbps or above. You can really hear any subtle nuances of instruments in the backround which is really an added plus. So if you get these headphones, make sure your music files are up to par.I cannot believe that that these headphones are under 100, and even further disbelief that i did not buy these earlier, they are one of the best headphones i have ever put on. Forget beats, go oldschool and get these studio monitors.Okay, these arnt all perfect, by now, my ears are getting a bit warm (lack of ventilation) but i guess that comes with any over ear headphones. Also, with thourough research, i found that the padding flakes off (the leather isnt real) BUT they can be replaced for under 20 bucks. Another padding that fits is the padding of Beyer DT-250 headphones which some say are a bit more comfortable, but i like these fine. These V6\'s last a very very long time, and is a great investment. I highly suggest it, you wont regret it.Also, a friend told me to let these play for a couple hours on high volume to ""break them in"". She also has these but for me, they play fine righto out of the box.',)"
"('Reelcraft L-4545-123-3 Electric Cord Reel with 12/3-Gauge 45-Foot CordThis cord reel is designed and manufactured to be used in commercial settings such as automobile repair facilities, where it\'s used dozens of times every day, year in and year out.  Shops can\'t be bothered with the frustration or breakdown, of inferior cord reels.- every aspect of this reel is high quality; heavy steel, strong spring, powder-coat finish, large support bracket, design, and workmanship, etc.  As long as it\'s not abused, this product should last for decades.  By comparison, the cheap imports are mostly plastic to keep the price low -- some even have plastic internal parts that wear out or fail too easily.- simple to pull out the cord length needed, and stop on any ""click"".  When done, it rewinds with ease and authority every time.  You don\'t need to baby it for the last 10\' to get it all on the reel - it just goes on.  The large rubber cord-stop can be easily moved so more, or less, cord hangs from the roller bracket.- the 45\' 12/3 cord is rubber sheathed, so it stays soft and flexible even in cold weather.  Unlike less expensive reels that might use the smaller 14 gauge or even 16 gauge wire, the 12/3 cord is more than adequate for any 110 volt tool, or even multiple tools.  Top-of-the-line Hubbell brand plug and receptacle are used.- the 4\' 12/3 pigtail should be long enough for most installations.  The right-angle fitting that protects where the pigtail goes into the unit, also keeps the cord close to the reel and out of the way.  If the combined draw via this cord will be greater than 15 amps, the pigtail needs to be plugged into a  receptacle that\'s on a 20 amp circuit.- this is the smallest commercial cord-reel of this length.  The reel itself is only 12"" in diameter and the unit projects a mere 13"" from the wall.- the roller bracket can be re-attached in any of 5 locations around the reel, for mounting on a wall, ceiling, bench, or wherever you want; so don\'t worry if the Amazon photo has it in the wrong place for your installation.  For example, refer to Customer Images for a different mounting location than Amazon\'s photo shows.- packing was excellent, with large molded plastic-wrapped foam blocks completely protecting the reel from damage.  Unsurprisingly, there was no shipping damage.There are other commercial-grade cord reels on the market, such as the Coxreel, but I don\'t see how theirs could be any better.  I also own a Grizzly H5695 12/3 cord reel, which costs 1/5 as much as this one, and is a terrific value.  However, comparing the Reelcraft to that Grizzly is like comparing a Milwaukee drill to a Ryobi drill.  Commercial quality versus homeowner quality.This is a lot to pay for a cord reel, but commercial grade reels are expensive.Highly recommended.',)"
"('Perhaps you want to dip a toe in the waters of shortwave radio listening. In my case, I wanted to give my kids a different perspective of the world around them than that which comes from the cliches and stereotypes presented on TV and in the movies. I\'d had a decent Sangean shortwave a number of years ago but was hoping that as technology marches forward, decent functionality might be available in cheaper units.Right off the bat, let\'s discard AM (medium wave) and FM. Those are commonly available. I have no interest in introducing my kids to the red-faced belligerents who populate the AM band. There\'s no reason to listen to FM radio if someone has a decent CD collection for the car. Even though the SG-622 offers both AM and FM, I bought this solely for the shortwave.Taking a cue from other reviews here I expected that shortwave reception would be weak, but also expected that connecting this to the antenna that had been used with my component stereo system would significantly increase the number of listenable signals received. First I should say that without the external antenna this unit is a paperweight. Listening at night as I used to do with the better shortwave receiver, the only thing this picked up in multiple listening sessions was three or four religious broadcasts that probably are readily available on AM radio if the political blowhards haven\'t driven everybody else off the dial.Adding the external antenna from the component stereo did make a significant difference in reception. More signals were indeed detected. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of them were unlistenable. I\'m not a shortwave enthusiast so I\'m only speculating that what such listeners mean by ""sensitivity"" or ""selectivity"" is a radio\'s ability to home in on a signal while suppressing general static and noise. Most of the time when some kind of signal would be detected, the SG-622 delivered it as one chunk of coherent sound bobbing about in a sea of white noise. Sifting through band after band of unlistenable signals turned up a handful of broadcasts that were coherent but significantly noisy. No Radio Australia or Radio Moscow or english language broadcasts from points around the globe, but rather, mostly just the occasional foreign language broadcast peppered in with the already mentioned doctrinal teachings. In short, the effort required wasn\'t worth the parsimonious results delivered.It\'s probably a safe guess that ""drift"" means either a signal slightly changing frequencies or a receiver\'s inability to stay locked onto a fixed signal. With the SG-622 I found that signals repeatedly drifted, to where it was best if I kept one hand on the dial in an attempt to follow the signal\'s shifts one way or the other. Never had to do that with the shortwave receiver I\'d used in the past.Listening to broadcasts from around the world can be a fascinating pastime, an activity to share with the kids. But if you want to stick a toe in those waters just to see how you like it, or how the kids take to it, without spending too much, this unit just isn\'t going to drum up any enthusiasm. It would be like buying a used Yugo to see if calling the tow truck from the side of the road inspires your teen to take up driving. This fails the effort/reward equation, this fails the cost/reward equation, and even when it lands a signal, it\'s the audio equivalent of watching a snowy TV screen. Don\'t abandon the idea of trying shortwave radio, but please, walk up the ladder to a better, higher priced model that will deliver enough listenability so that you or your kid can make an informed decision on pursuing this further.',)"

You can search for shows to record by Time, Channel, Name or Genre, and you can get a &quot;Season Pass&quot; in order to record the show whenever it's on.I love always having a selection of shows I like ready for me to watch, instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something. Though there may not be a full 30 hours of recording time on the TiVo (30 hours is only with &quot;Basic&quot; sub-par Quality picture-- and Best Quality you can only record 9 hours), I still find that I always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows. I've actually found that I don't watch MORE TV now that I have the TiVo, I just watch TV shows that I actually like, at times when I am available. I get more homework done now (no joke). If there is extra room available, the TiVo actually records TV Shows that it &quot;thinks&quot; that you would like, since you are able to rate TV Shows and Movies, it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy. For example, if you give &quot;Friends&quot; 3 thumbs up, it may record &quot;Seinfeld&quot; for you if you have extra room. If you don't want the shows it it records, you can simply delete them or give them a &quot;Thumbs Down&quot; rating. The more shows you rate, the better TiVo understands your personal tastes. The only thing I wish it could do is record on one channel while I watch another, but it is understandable that it cannot. Also, TiVo comes up with &quot;updates&quot; now and again to improve on its features, so if something isn't perfect now, it may be improved in the future. For example, some reviewers complained that while recording sports, TiVo would fail to record if the game went into overtime, but now TiVo has a feature which lets you &quot;cushion&quot; your recordings by however much time you want, to ensure that you don't miss anything.One of the best features by far is a the &quot;Live TV Guide&quot; -- if you just press the &quot;Live TV Guide&quot; button while watching TV, a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie, a brief plot summary, who the actors are, when it started, when it ends and what's on after it. Watching TV was never so easy. Whenever I show my friends how TiVo works, they are amazed by how we can pause, go get a drink or go to the bathroom, then come back and fast forward through all the commercials. You'll also never have to say &quot;Wait! What happened?? I missed it!&quot; because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it again.I know that I am gushing about this, but TiVo seriosly has changed the way I watch TV-- as many other reviewers have said, TiVo lets YOU control your TV, not the other way around. I think that I'll be using it for a long, long time from now, and I have no regrets about buying it."",)"

"('Iomega ZIP 250 Parallel Port DriveThis device allows both storage and transfer and works on any bi-directional or EPP parallel port. For best results, you should run the ""Parallel Port Accelerator"" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 250Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device. Most printers will operate from the printer port on the back. The 250 MB unit can read and write the more popular 100Mb disks as well.The ""User\'s Manual"" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega ""Copy Machine"" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega ""Format"" function. Use ""Short Format"" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The ""Long Format"" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. ""Write Protection"" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as ""non-removable"" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn\'t work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letters assigned after the hard drives. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first (""daisy chaining""). This changes the drive letters assigned to CD-drives. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. A ZIP disk never has compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties\'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics\', then `Close\' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info\' on the `Disk Type\' Note the `Disk Life Status\' and the `Format Life Status\'.

"('I recently purchased a Hewlett Packard Digital Camera that came with a 4 mb flash card.  The Vikings 128 mb flashcard is great.  At Xmas I took 52 pictures and still had 167 pictures available to take on the card.  I recommend this card to anyone who, like myself loves to take pictures.',)"
"('Late this summer, I was driving a rented minivan from Mendocino, CA, south to the Bay area. It\'s about 180 miles. I was with three other adults and three children. Instead of taking the recommended RT 128 southeast to RT 101 and south to the Bay area, we decided to take a ""shorter"" route, due east on Lake Road to RT 20 to RT 101, then south. Well, the road we chose went through deep redwood forests. More often then not, we could not see the sky. There were times when the road was no longer paved, at times rutted. It was so narrow that for most of the way it would have been impossible for two vehicles to pass (fortunately, no vehicles came our way). The road often snaked around tree trunks as large as 10 feet in diameter.This road was on both our AAA map and GPS (I had preloaded the corresponding map onto my 64mb data card from the MetroGuide CD). The going was very slow, and our ""shorter"" route soon became the ""longer"" route. We were too far along to turn around. My wife, seated in the back held the portable phone ready to call for assistance. I asked all to wait, to put her trust in the GPS. After another half hour, we came to a three-road junction--all narrow and un-maintained. One of the roads was not on the AAA map. Intuitively, it looked like the least likely road. But the GPS indicated this road would take us to the RT 20. We took it, and before you knew it, arrived at the conventional RT 20. The GPS saved the day.One of the greatest attributes of a GPS is that it allows you to explore, to go where you normally would not, and discover new vistas. Obviously, my eMap proved that.Besides this general function, there are several specific features I like about the eMap. These include its portability and its ergonomic design. The eMap has a relatively large display (which can be backlit) and it is light, just over 6 oz. When walking with this unit in a town or on a trail, I appreciate being able to hold and control the unit with one hand while always having the display in view. This is a result of the control buttons being below the screen.The eMap is compatible with Garmin\'s downloadable MapSource CDs. These include U.S. Roads and Recreation, WorldMap, U.S. Topo, and MetroGuide U.S.A. With the MapGuide U.S.A. CD, the eMap can look up addresses and telephone numbers for nearby services and points of interest. I like being able find a particular restaurant or street address by entering it under the find feature, then tracking it. An arrow will point in the right direction and distance will be displayed.There are many available accessories, several which I recommend. I needed a larger data card. The unit comes with an 8mb card which will give you one region. This is okay if you will be using it in a limited radius. If you go elsewhere, you\'ll need to load new data using a serial cable (another accessory). It is time consuming, which may suggest your getting another accessory, the Garmin\'s USB data programmer. I have a 64mb card which captures from Massachusetts to Maryland (8 regions). Using the serial cable took over two hours to load the data. Using the programmer took about four minutes.I definitely recommend this unit. Its portability, versatility, its adjustable detail, and its accuracy give you the confidence to venture places without getting lost. One suggestion though--don\'t give up the paper map. Use it to provide the fuller perspective a portable GPS lacks.',)"

"(""I ordered a 3rd unit to replace one of two that had crashed (non stop scanning for a DVD until it got to 2nd machine.  I figured the 1st unit crashing was a fluke,so 8 months after getting the 3rd unit guess what  non stop DVD scanning...Cause is an obviously piss poor spindle motor being asked to be the center of a DVD Jukebox.How do I know this.. well open the darn thing up and give that little motor a bit of persuasion and presto it works and will do so for a couple hours until it sticks again.Currently have a spindle motor on order for the first ($44 from Pioneer, plus whatever time it takes me to swap it out.),  will try and see if the one year parts from pioneer takes care of the last.Why these machines have such a inadequate spin motor is beyond me. Just be warned since this motor seems to be used on the bulk of their DVD products.Other than that I love that I can have up to 600 DVD's stored and playable at the press of a button. I just want better reliability out of them.** Follow up **After shipping and everything new spin motor was $64.  It is a bit technical to install, so if you have never done anything like it suggest repair shop or someone that has.  Tools needed:  solder iron,  jewelers phillips, #2 Phillips, small needle nose, magnet or fingers for screw drivers, paper and pencil (clean place to work is a must also)To get to motor...remove cover, the entrire circuitry board sitting on top rear of machine  (4 screws),  the upper portion of the disc tray (6 screws), armature that pushed dvd into place and finally the assebmy that contains motor and disc read.To pull circuit board assembly, most connections are simple push in hardened circuit runs. There are also 4 connections with grey wire running to them that only require the upper portion of the white connectors be pulled up a bit so that the wire pulls from them. Remember all these connections and how they run, especially with the motor as they will bind up the system if you run them wrong.To get to motor there is one screw that has to be removed on the motor assembly along with a spring. Next there are 4 blue rubber shock absorbers, that can be unseated with the #2 phillips by gently poking them out. Finally just press back a tab that holds assemble in plastic mount and pull it out.You will have to look through spindle to see the 2 screws that attach motor to the assembly, they are itty bitty things so becareful. Last desolder old connections red and black wire and reassemble in reverse order, making sure everything is free to move correctly.  There is one circuit run that if not put in properly will cause the assmebly to not beable to read your disc as it will bind system up, so carfully make sure it is free to slide back and forth without binding after you reassemble it and before putting the housing back into system.Give it a good look over before firing it up and use a single disc to check it out. I had to pull cover back off as I had no remote or out put.. darn a pair of feeds that got pushed under circuit card.Everything back together and machine is working like new again (yeah) Just hope this replacement motor lasts longer than the original now  :-)"",)"
"(""I'll admit it, I'm a techno-junkie.  I have to have all of the new-fangled gadgets that are out there.  Call it compulsion.  I bought the Creative Nomad II for the sole purpose of having one, but after I received the product, I came away with a product I can't help but be pleased with.For such a small device, the sound on this gadget is incredible. I can't believe I'm listening to an MP3 from such a small device. Let's forget that the SmartMedia card I have holds 64 Megabytes (a feat on such a small card is just unimaginable to me).  You can control the treble and bass (along with 4 presets Rock, Pop, Classical, and Jazz).  Best of all, the skips are very rare.  Unlike what most people have said here, I've had one or two. Nothing major, but a few for some reason.  The battery was full, if you're keeping score at home.I love the voice recorder.  This innovation automatically makes the Nomad II a more useful tool outside of listening to music.  With the capability to record 4 hours worth of sound bytes (with a 64 MB card), you could record a 3-hour lecture, transfer it to your computer, and keep an archive of them, without worrying about having enough tapes or missing something in your notes.I only gave the product four stars for a variety of reasons.  Even though I marvel at the size of the SmartMedia card in relation to the memory on it, I'm always afraid I'm going to snap it in half when I place it in the Nomad II.  If you're careful, you'll be fine. I'm afraid that if I break it, I might have to shell out another ($) or so to replace it.  I also found the navigation to be a bit hairy in some instances.  Then again, I have a big thumb, so take that comment with a grain of salt.  I also did not lkiek the fact trhat I had to buy a separate docking cradle, although Amazon does have, in my research, the best price for it.Overall, this is a great product.

"('Well, if you\'re here, then you probably know what you\'re looking at. If not, let me explain.The HD600 was introduced by Sennheiser as the replacement for their highly acclaimed HD580. It was essentially the HD580 Jubilee edition, but re-dressed and re-badged. As such, it shares nearly everything with the HD580 Jubilee, and shares it\'s drivers with the HD580. The HD600 has been on Stereophile\'s A list for ages, and hasn\'t budged despite passing years and many new models from competitors. It has also been the golden standard for neutrality and accuracy in recording studios worldwide.What does the HD600 sound like? Quite simply, it sounds much like the components that you have upstream, but with more weight and body to the sound. The HD600 is uncolored enough that every change in your signal path results in a different sound signature. You hear exactly how your CD player sounds, how your amp sounds, how your cables sound (yes, I know this statement disqualifies me with the audio cynics... well, so be it). In my experience with hi-fi and more specifically headphone hi-fi, I\'ve yet to find another headphone that sounds so neutral, so very ""right"" with everything that I throw at it.It is detailed, but presents detail in a relaxed manner. It is very airy and open but doesn\'t sound thin. It has a strong bass but it\'s quite clear and well defined. It has a melodic midrange but it\'s clean and articulate. It has exactly the right tone and tembre on every instrument. And it does it all in a very coherent, integrated fashion. Everything is part of a greater sonic whole, and works together in a coherent fashion to recreate beautiful music. Most prominently, it has a sense of weight and solidity to every sound that is very much speaker-like. I have heard this kind of solidity in other headphones, but in many cases it has worked detrimentally to the music. In this case, it adds a sense of magical realism that\'s hard to find elsewhere.You probably are aware that this headphone needs an amp. That\'s definitely true. Don\'t connect it to an mp3 player expecting it to sing, because it won\'t. A dedicated headphone amplifier is a must. I will also go further than that and say that a dedicated hi-fi source is a must, since this headphone does, once again, sound like it\'s upstream components.Here\'s what I suggest for building a good headphone rig around the HD600:Start with an inexpensive source with an optical line-out. A cheap Sony D-NE920 will do quite well, or any other PCDP with an optical line-out. Next, get a standalone DAC, either a portable battery powered model like a Headroom MicroDAC (amazing little product) or a full-size jitter-immune DAC like the Benchmark DAC1. Next, if you\'re going the portable route, get a good portable amp - I use the Ray Samuels Hornet currently, and it\'s a killer piece of amplification. If you\'re going with a stationary home DAC, then make sure that it has balanced outputs, and get a true balanced amplifier (Headamp GS-X is a good model, as is the Heardoom Max Balanced, or perhaps a cheaper but still excellent SFT-build balanced M^3). Finish it off with a decent set of IC\'s (Grover Ultimate Reference is a great inexpensive cable), and replace the dinky cable that came with your HD600\'s (I like the Moon Audio cables myself). You\'ll need an XLR-terminated cable for your balanced amp. You can throw in power conditioning if you believe in that sort of thing, but it\'s really up to you. Lastly, throw on your favorite recording, relax, and enjoy. For this is what the HD600 will do - relax and let the music flow.I\'ve heard some very serious phones - the Sennheiser Orpheus, Sony MDR-R10, Sony Qualia 010, together with countless less-expensive phones. Properly amped and properly driven, the HD600 can play with the best of them. It\'s a real steal at the price, but make sure to pair it with quality gear.****Let me address some previous reviews.To the gentleman who claimed that this sounds muddy next to Stax headphones - I agree. Stax headphones really are unique in terms of clarity, but since they\'re electrostatic, this is to be expected. However, driven balanced, the HD600 can come close to this sort of clarity, and will be more realistic in terms of tembre and texture. I prefer it in some ways over the SR-007, and I own the SR-404 myself, so I\'m no stranger to Stax.To the reviewer below who claims that the A900 and MDR-V7506 are better phones: I suggest you get your facts straight. The HD600 is used nearly as much as the V7506 in the studio. I also happen to own the A900, and I honestly cannot say that it sounds just as natural as the HD600. It has an upper-midrange honky coloration that is distinctly artificial. Having played piano for 13 years, I know how the instrument is supposed to sound, and the HD600 is it. The A900 isn\'t. But, I will agree with you, to some extent, when it comes to the HD650. This latter phone is voiced rather differently from the HD600, and does sound colored to my ears.',)"

"('So I\'ve recently received my Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones, and I\'ve gotta say, I\'m impressed! Cheap headphones have come a long way, but these really do take the cake. I\'ve had dozens of headphones in my life, and working in the video production field, I\'ve used some really pricey ones (don\'t get me wrong, there\'s a big difference between this type of headphone and high-quality monitor headphones).These are the perfect music/leisure headphones. They have great sound, but the surprising part is how much bass these things put out! It\'s like having a sub right next to your ear! However, I will point out, these things do put out a little too much bass to be accurate right off the bat, but an EQ can fix that if you prefer a more ""harmonious"" sound; if you like your bass, then you won\'t have to do a thing. The overall sound output is pretty decent: lows, mids, highs, they\'re all there. Now, these are cheap so accuracy is a different story (these are slightly muddy compared to more expensive headphones), but like I said, these are leisure headphones, which work excellent for listening to rock/pop/rap, etc. Unless you plan on dishing out $40+, you won\'t find anything better, and those still might not be great for music listening, since you kinda want that accentuated bass/booming tone for most music (or at least I do).So, these are cheap headphones, don\'t expect them to last forever, but if taken care of, there\'s nothing mechanically flawed in the pair. This is the old-school defacto design, and it kinda makes me laugh to see we\'ve moved away from this design for buds (which, at least they have improved, but still don\'t compare). Since these aren\'t buds or noise canceling, others will be able to hear your music at higher volumes, but it really isn\'t that bad, since these have ""ports"" I figured it might be louder externally than it actually is.I believe another reviewer pointed this out already, but the title is misleading, the port is merely referring to a literal ""port"" or hole, so that bass can be amplified in the compact design; there aren\'t like extra plugs or anything wacky on these headphones, just the normal 3.5mm headphones jack. The packaging doesn\'t even have any mention of the port, which I\'m assuming they removed due to confusion; I only knew what XBS was because they used to have it slapped on their products. Also, the cord is 4.5ft in case you wanted to know, I couldn\'t find that anywhere on Amazon, had to go to another site to find that out; that length is perfect for me, since they are plugged into the front audio jack on a PC sitting on the floor. My previous iPod buds were 3ft and I had to tilt my head to use them.So, all in all, you should buy these. I\'m glad I bought them, may buy half a dozen more to be honest, I really enjoy these little headphones!',)"

"(""The Fujifilm FinePix 1400 Zoom digital still camera is a sleek and handsome device styled with a familiar &quot;point-and-shoot camera&quot; sort of design. Controls are reasonably well laid-out and fairly easy to  handle, even for middle-aged hands and thick fingers like mine.For the  record, this is my first digital camera. I regard myself as an  &quot;intermediate&quot; amateur in 35mm film photography, and desktop  computer operations.Though I have not yet made any prints from the  digital images I have taken with this camera, I am very well satisfied with  the color and sharpness in the daylight macro images taken in my rose  garden as I view them on my iMac. The attempt to photograph my nephews'  graduation from the bleachers of a high school gymnasium, however, revealed  the limitations of the modest built-in flash, and the lens' ability to pick  up &quot;ghosts&quot; of the overhead lighting.The camera can take  pictures in your choice of three quality levels (basic, normal, or fine)  and one of two pixel sizes (640x480 or 1280x960). A 320x240 file size can  accomplished by editing a recorded image using the &quot;resize&quot;  function. Indeed, any larger size can be reduced to a smaller size (to the  minimum 320x240). This can save space on the SmartMedia card, or reduce  transmission time over internet email, for instance.The camera comes  with one 4MB SmartMedia card. According to the owners manual, the  &quot;standard&quot; number of 1280x960 images which can be recorded in 4MB  ranges from 6 &quot;fine&quot; to 12 &quot;normal&quot; to 23  &quot;basic;&quot; and the number of 640x480 images ranges from 23  &quot;fine&quot; to 44 &quot;normal&quot; to 69 &quot;basic&quot;. The  manual goes on to say that actual capacity &quot;varies slightly depending  on the type of subject.&quot;The highly recommended purchase of a 32MB  card increases 1280x960 &quot;standard&quot; capacity to 50  &quot;fine,&quot; 99 &quot;normal,&quot; and 180 &quot;basic&quot; images;  and 640x480 &quot;standard&quot; capacity to 180 &quot;fine,&quot; 330  &quot;normal,&quot; and 496 &quot;basic&quot; images.An indoor flash  picture of a furnished room revealed some barely detectable  &quot;jaggies&quot; along the edges of a lamp shade in the  &quot;normal&quot; mode. Switching to &quot;fine&quot; eliminated these  altogether. (BTW, in a normal-size room, the flash exposure was ample.)I  must agree with the many reviewers who have written that the LCD display is  a bit too small and not bright enough to see easily in full sunlight, but I  have found that a &quot;banker's visor&quot; or &quot;big bubba&quot;  billed cap can help.The optical viewfinder is another solution, and is  especially useful because it actually &quot;zooms&quot; along with the lens  in pseudo-SLR fashion. But unlike a true thru-the-lens viewer, the parallax  error in this camera is significant. Because the &quot;film&quot; does not  &quot;see&quot; exactly the same &quot;frame&quot; as the optical  viewfinder, you might end up cutting off Aunt Mildred's head in that next  photo if you don't take care.The camera manuals, though they still sound  a bit &quot;translated,&quot; are actually very informative, well  organized, and well thought-out. The installation of the software drivers,  and downloading over the USB interface to my iMac with MacOS 8.6 went  without a hitch.Besides a larger SmartMedia card, other recommendable  additions include one (or better yet, two) full sets of rechargeable  batteries with recharger. And, if you plan to spend time using the  in-camera editing features, consider getting the AC adapter,  too.Playback functions include a nice nine-image LCD  &quot;thumbnail&quot; display mode. And those with advanced interests might  want to take advantage of the camera's ability to edit various Digital  Print Order Format (DPOF) settings.My verdict on the Fujifilm FinePix  1400 Zoom is that it is a very good value as an entry-level digital camera  capable (within reasonable limits) of capturing excellent images for  computer viewing. In today's marketplace, there are but two or three that  can directly compete with it for price and features - especially for owners  of USB equipped computers."",)"
"(""This is the same lens that came on my 300 digital rebel that I bought about 10 years ago, shot about 40,000 photos with it, gave to my son and the shutter failed, sent to Canon and had it repaired and gave to my daughter.

"('On a tight budget when I purchased my dRebel almost two years ago - this lens looked very attractive. Since owning it for two years - it seems to go further and further to the back of my equipment bag - and not taken in my backpack at all unless the climate is too harsh for my more expensive lenses.In fairness to the product - it is very GOOD for what it cost and how it is designed. It makes no pretension to be anything other than an AF f5.6 >75-300mm&lt; telephoto. The construction has remained solid - the zoom (fairly stiff or tight when new)sometimes makes funny noises from grit lodged in the \'nether regions\' of the lens barrel (I am a defense contractor who travels to some pretty rotten climates). Dust and dirt do not seem to be a serious problem with regular maintenance of brush and blower around the rotating parts of the lens barrel.Things I enjoyed with this purchase:1. Light weight, solid construction2. Acceptable optical quality in sunny outdoor use3. Accepts the same filters (58mm) as my dRebel kit lens4. Affordable for those on a tight budget5. Compatible with the dRebel autofocus and auto exposure system6. Expendable (if something bad happens) in harsh climates7. Draws absolutely no attention from customs inspectors, (or anyone looking to steal your stuff) when clearing security at ports of entry or return. Clears airport security without manual inspection.Unsatisfactory/annoying qualities that quickly became evident:1. f4-5.6 limited my use indoors or low light. Plan to spend much time in Photoshop to save your pictures2. Length of lens made it unusable with the dRebel pop-up flash (lens shadow). Immediate purchase of a 420EX Speedlight ($177+ see my review) cured this problem3. Front focus rotating lens element limited my filter choices to UV (haze) filter only4. Annoyingly SLOW auto focus5. Tripod is almost manditory with lower shutter speeds (see f4- 5.6 limits). The 1.6x magnification factor when seated to the dRebel brings the focal length out to over 450mm making off tripod use risky* Use of a BGE-1 battery grip ($100+ see my review) with this lens - lowers camera center of gravity-extra counter-weight makes lens use less stressful.Good price - fair optics - limited overall performance. Limits for the serious photographer make one want to look elsewhere. SIGMA has superior product in this price category, as well as the house brand at Ritz/Wolf Camera chains-while the discriminating photographer who has the resources should look seriously at Canon\'s ""L"" series (as I\'ve done) or \'IS\' series as suggested by other experienced reviewers.',)"

"(""I have been an avid birder watcher for several decades. I've owned most of the top-of -the-line European binoculars (Zeiss, Leica, etc.) over the years.  I purchased the Canon 12x36 IS binocs over 2 1/2 years ago and I love them.  However, thinking that more magnification would be better, I ordered the 18x50 IS pair a year later.  I have since sold them and use mostly the Canon 12 power.  Here are a few reasons why they were not right for me:*  Bigger is not always better.  The extra weight and size caused me to leave them in the closet and take the 12x36s, one of my other pair, or worst, no binoculars at all.  Even the best optics are no good if you don't have them with you when you need them.*  Smaller field of view.  It takes some practice seeing a bird with your naked eyes and then swinging the binoculars up smoothly so that you keep the bird (or any other small subject) in line with your vision.  As experienced as I am at this I found it harder to accomplish with the narrow view of these powerful optics.  Sometimes all you get is a few seconds to spot and identify a rare bird.  Quicker is better.*  Shallower depth of field.  With greater magnification the accuracy of your focusing becomes more critical due to a reduced range of focus.  With distant objects I found myself fiddling with focus knob more than I would like to.*  Less than the best optical performance.  Don't get me wrong, these are very sharp, high quality glasses, just not the best.  When viewing objects against the sun you can get a color flare, or ghost image (chromatic aberration).  Only the highest quality optical designs get close to completely eliminating this problem.  When you are trying to tell one bird from another closely related species, color is often all than you have to go by.I am still a big fan of the Image Stabilization technology and I still use my 12x36 IS binoculars daily, however, the idea that more magnification is always better, especially for birding, is misleading.  I am planning to buy the Canon 10x42 L series binos. In the past this magnification has been my favorite and the added benefit of IS will make it an even better choice.  The biggest reason for this decision is the superiority of the L class optics.  I own several L lenses for my Canon digital SLRs and they are superb.If you don't mind the size and weight, or you really need the extra power (like for astronomical observation) these are great binoculars to add to your collection.  If you looking one pair to use on a regular basis and you want the best optical quality combined with image stabilization, I would go with the 10x42 IS L glasses and save yourself the time and expense of buying the wrong pair.  But that's just my opinion. If you can, take a look at both of them in person before you buy one.Canon 10x42 L Image Stabilization Waterproof Binoculars"",)"
"(""My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card. Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.Three things make this camera a particularly good buy:First, and most importantly, its size makes it SO CONVENIENT. I have had absolutely no qualms dropping the S100 in a bag or pocket and walking out to a birthday party, a sports event, or whatever--space simply isn't an issue with this camera. As a result, I have taken some of the best shots of friends and family with the Canon.Second, the feature set is basic, but very easy to use. The power button is a simple button--no toggle thumb switches with multiple settings that can sometimes be confusing. Switching between viewing and capturing modes is simple and straightforward, and even the more advanced features (such as changing the flash mode) are easy to figure out even without reading the manual.Finally, the &quot;built in&quot; lense cap is a big plus. I didn't realize how nice this &quot;feature&quot; is until I briefly used a friend's digital camera and had to remove and replace the lense cap WITH EVERY SHOT. The built in cap seems insignificant with light use, but when taking many shots over the course of a few hours, the S100 really shines.Photographers should be warned, however, that the S100 is not a professional-level camera by any means. The 2.1 megapixel resolution, while not meager, is not enough to yield even high-quality 5x7's. Serious cropping of a photo is usually out of the question because of the limited resolution.So, if you will be using your camera as a &quot;fun&quot; camera--for casual pictures--look no further. This is the one. If you're serious about picture quality, compare the S100 carefully to its larger siblings--the S20, and the G1.Overall, a fantastic little camera."",)"

"(""Ive had this camera for 9 months, and I have grown very attached to it. I've beat the crap out of it and it still works fine, a good sign.It fits in ones hand like a crazy optical-recepting hand gun.  After time and experimenting, one grows accustomed to its grip and it's small size makes the human subjects less nervous, almost as if no video camera is there, just a miniscule receptor of their realtime image.If you have a friend with one of these too (Scheeronious), you can firewire the 2 cameras together and do some improvisational editing and recording of footage, easily.infrared night-vison, with &quot;old movie&quot;  to make night shots mystical... overlap fading face-morphing,  Luminscennt effects. Manual exposure adjusting to tweak the lighting, in conjuction with slow-shutter surrealism.  &gt;&gt;&gt; The camera give you a lot of room to play.I use the memory stick all the time to capture stills off my prerecorded footage.  I like the small 640x480 jpegs, its easier to work with in photoshop, transfers quick, save-em-stright-to-floppy or email-em size.  If one really wants high quality pics one has to capture the live still straight to the stick. raltime capture even makes a simulated digital &quot;cli-click&quot; sound of an SLR camera when you hit the photo button.  Sony style at its best.This camera is great on an airplane, to watch all your old movies in-transit, and catch stills off of them.  If you really wanted to, you could easily record tv, movies etc.., and watch it on this camera on the plane almost like a MiniDVD player.Problems: 1. You can't use fader and digital effects at the same time. 2. You can't activate digital effects with the LCD closed. 3. The built-in microphone doesn't pick up low bass frequencies real well. 3. upgrade this camera with a wide angle lens, and extended life battery, and 32 meg stick.  Wide angle is a must, it creates a more immersive viewer experience."",)"

"(""I've been waiting for something like this for forever. I've gone through my share of MP3 players, minidisc players, walkmans and discmans, but so far nothing has had the versatility that the Nomad Jukebox has. My problem is that whenever I travel I insist that I can't survive without bringing my entire CD collection, and it's annoying (and risky) to lug around that many CDs. Minidiscs provided a solution for a while, but it was to much hassle to spend so much time recording &amp; editing the minidiscs manually without the help of a computer program. MP3 players like the Rio 500 &amp; Nomad II are great for day use &amp; jogging, but most of the time 1 hour just doesn't cut it. MP3-CD players don't seem worth it to me because you still have to buy a CD burner &amp; carry around CDs. The Nomad Jukebox is for people who want a MASSIVE amount of music (6 GIGs, 100+ hours, which is 100x more than most Mp3 players, at around the same price) for use over a long period of time or at home.The Jukebox comes bundled with software for PlayCenter 2 (for the PC) or SoundJam (for Macs) to use for ripping CDs &amp; Mp3s from your computer to the Jukebox. It also comes with decent headphones (loudness is NOT a problem) &amp; a carrying case, plus all the necessary equipment for setting it up. Setup is pretty easy, and using the software is a lot more intuitive than I though it would be. It takes me around 5 minutes to rip a CD from my computer the the Nomad. The best feature by far is the OMD description searcher-- if you're online while your ripping CDs, the OMD finds the album name, year released, genre, artist, &amp; ALL the track names, so you don't have to type anything in. You can also rip Mp3s from the Nomad back to your computer. The songs in the Nomad can be categorized under Albums, Artists, Genres or Play Lists to make it easier to navigate. It supports data, MP3, WMA, and WAV files (plus many others). You can download updates from the Nomad website for better software or firmware for the player, so even if something isn't perfect now, in the future improvements will be available. The player also has an infrared port on the front for future additions (like a remote control). It comes with 2 hours of free music (mostly classical) and some Audio Books. It includes jacks for line-in recording from radios, microphones or stereos,  and line-out hookup to stereos or speakers.Of course, the Nomad Jukebox is a very new kind of Mp3 player, so it has a few MAJOR flaws:1) BATTERY POWER- Hard Drives tend to suck up an endless amount of power, and that's exactly what the Jukebox is-- a Hard Drive disguised as an Mp3 player. You can ONLY use the 4 rechargeable batteries that Nomad gives you (AA size) to run it without the AC adapter, and those only last around 3-4 hours by themselves. Nomad includes an extra set of 4 to replace them, but you always have to make sure they are fully charged. Maybe in the future there will be more options (battery pack?)2) WEIGHT - It's around the size of a first-generation CD player, and it weighs around 2 lbs with batteries. This isn't really a problem for me, but it depends what you want to use it for. It's not meant for use while jogging or biking, etc-- it's more for use over a long period of time away from home, on the bus/plane/dorm/in the car, or at home, plugged into the AC adapter and a pair of speakers. Besides the weight, in my opinion, it looks VERY nice- it has unique, smooth design, coloring and shape (and the LCD screen is easy to read).The Nomad Jukebox is the best in its category of high-capacity Mp3 players-- It holds 100 times more music than a normal Mp3 player, and its price has been drastically reduced, making it a lot more affordable than it was before. Overall, I am very satisfied with it. It has its flaws, but in the future there will be improvements &amp; upgrades available. It is the best option for anyone who's ever wished they could bring all their CDs with them without actually having to CARRY them... and I think that I will be using it for a long, long time from now."",)"
"('This lens is intermediately priced, good Macro Lens.This focal length is particularly useful since its 100mm focal length (160mm on APS-C lineup) can achieve reasonable result for both Portrait photography and Macro Photography.With this lens, you can get pretty close to your subject without much of compromise.  Focus is reasonably fast, that is somewhat sufficient to chase small animal if used with camera such as 20D, 30D, 1D MKII.But, if you shoot small creature professionally, you might feel bit awkward at some point as it is very easy to hit limitation of current AF technology, if so, it might be better off switch to MF quickly to chase the subject.  And this lens perform reasonably well on the MF mode as well.But, you really have to use it with full sensor DSLR such as 5D or 1DS series to get your money worth from this lens.  You will love bokeh this lens will create when you shoot with this lens.While it will not match optical performance of EF 180mm f/3.5 L USM Macro Lens  (As it cost nearly 2.5 times) as macro lens, it will certainly focus faster, easy to carry, and It is very sharp and perform well for other function such as for portrait .Of course, I will not say it will match performance of true portrait lens from Canon that sports much wider aperture, but this lens came pretty close, and you can get away with the most of professional assignment with this.I just recently completed photo shoot for some professional magazine article that catered for designer and photographer, and this lens perform superbly along with more expensive L variety lens.  So, this lens is pretty reliable.Some professional pointed vignetting issue at f/2.8, though I did not notice much.  My shooting style does not required to take notice as I tend to stopped down to shoot subject when I am using this lens, but it is possible to be a issue for some people who tend to shoot at wide open.As a Macro Lens, this lens will really shine when stopped down to beyond f/16 or so, as it is true macro lens designed to shine at those f-stop range.This focal length are popular for macro photography, and there are other budget solution from third party manufacture, and few OEM brands that sports Auto Focus mode exist, but they will not match optical performance of EF100 f/2.8 USM Macro Lens as this lens is very nice at almost all f-stop whereas third party solution is tend to be good at particular f-stop .It does not weigh much, so it will not going to be your burden.  When I am on the field, I tend to carry 3 large zoom + one or two fixed focus lens, and this lens will be one of such lens to bring if I have to choose among prime lens.It also makes decent product photography lens, though if you have extra budget, I would go for the TS-E 90mm f/2.8 Tilt-Shift Lens as it is a lens designed for that particular purpose.  But, when you are on the field, and asked to do quick work on the spot, EF 100mm f/2.8 USM Macro will handle job just fine.Pro:Excellent optical performance at all f-stop. And it is suited for number of purpose.  Consider it as utility telephoto prime lens.Good Starter Lens for Macro Photography, and easiest to master compared to other Macro solution offered at the Canon EF system.Con:Hood or Pouch are not included, and you will need them!',)"
"('This is a review for beginners by some one who\'s still learning. If you\'re an experienced photographer, just consider the 5 stars and read other reviews.The quality of this lens is great. As many reviewers have pointed out, the image quality is sharp and the colors excellent. This should come as no surprise, macro lenses are usually some of the best lenses made. And of course it focuses all the way to infinity as well, so that you can use it as a ""general purpose"" lens.Depending on what you use the camera for, this is probably not a carry around lens. The 100mm focal length (equivalent to 160mm on APS-C sensor cameras such as 20D) makes it difficult to use it - I find myself having to move back and reposition myself very often, and may result in a missed opportunity.A few other accessories will come in really useful to get consistently good macro photos.- A stable tripod- A remote release cable- External flash- Books about photography, if you don\'t have them alreadyI have the first, just bought the second, and thinking about the third. Amphoto has some very good books on photography. I find ""Understanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson to be very well written and easy to read.A remote cord will prevent camera shake when pressing the shutter. I\'ve tried using timer mode to compensate for the lack of a remote cable release. The problem with that is that when the timer goes off, the breeze that died down may have picked up again, and my carefully framed flower is now halfway out of the photo, and is blurry as well. I never realized how windy it is in my backyard until I tried taking macro photos of plants.Why a tripod? To achieve maximum depth of field (more areas in sharp focus), you need a small aperture. A small aperture means a slower shutter speed to get a correct exposure. Boosting the ISO too far will result in noise. That means that unless there is a blinding amount of light (this is where the flash comes in) you\'re unlikely to be able to hold the camera still enough to prevent blurring. The only thing worse about a macro photo with only a small area in sharp focus is a blurred macro photo. And remember, stable is the key word. A cheap shaky tripod may not be much better than no tripod.Speaking of light, try not to take outdoor macro photos (or any outdoor photos) under strong direct sunlight if you can avoid it. You\'ll find the color washed out compared to an overcast day, or early morning / evening. Or you can use a light diffuser, but that\'s yet another accessory to carry around.As an alternative to a remote release, you can use a laptop, USB cable and software. It is rather more difficult to carry around, and you can get a 3rd party remote release for around 1/3 the price of the Canon original.',)"

"(""I honestly felt compelled to write this after reading many of the other reviews.  It seems that everyone out there rating the product high has &quot;just got it this morning&quot; and everyone else seems to be complaining about repairs and such.Well, my case is different.  I bought my Nomad II MG a little over a year ago along with a friend of mine.  We got them at the same time, from the same store and with an extra 64MB (total 128MB).I use the unit every day while going to and from the office (at least 2 hours a day).  In my experience, the battery will not last more than 5-6 hours (they say 8).  Having said that, I have not had to replace the battery.Let me get the bad out of the way first...- The buttons are extremely sensitive.  After a while, I wound up locking up the unit and just let it run on random.- Random logic seems &quot;not so random&quot;.- Controls are not intuitive and take some getting used to.- SmartMedia card will sometimes stop working.  Shutdown, remove and replace usually solves this.- The headphones are horrible!  Extremely uncomfortable!  I wound up buying Sony Phonotopia.- There was a shutdown problem while docked which was solved when I upgraded firmware.If after reading the previous list you think I hate this unit, think again...  I love it!This unit is extremely light, small and portable.  You can carry it in a shirt pocket.  Easy to carry in any season.If you get the 128MB total, you have an average 2 hours of music to go along with you.  Got tired of the same music?  Switch to the FM tuner and you're good to go. (or switch to 96kbps sampling rate and cram more songs in)This unit has great sound.  I also found it to be loud enough for my taste.  I always use sound level at 30 (50 max).For the record, the sync software is very easy to use...My friend has had the same experience with this MP3 player as I have.  We're both very happy with it and I would buy it again in a heartbeat."",)"

"('IntroductionSome time ago, I was browsing a few of my favorite sites when I came across a deal for two pairs of the MX400 earbuds. The price was right and given my lack of quality earbuds, I decided to jump on this deal, if only to have a decent pair of earbuds I can use to listen to my music at times where isolation from the surrounding environment is not quite ideal. When I received them after a few days, I began burning them in as per my usual, listening to them intermittently throughout the process. What I heard was actually quite surprising.Design and Build QualityConstructed entirely of plastic, the housings of the MX400 don\'t exactly inspire confidence and feel rather cheap to the touch. The plastic cabling is quite tangle-prone and isn\'t quite as soft or flexible as I would\'ve liked and terminates in a nickel-plated 3.5mm straight jack. As a whole, the MX400s don\'t seem like they would be able to stand up to a great deal of abuse and should be toted around in a case, if at all possible.Sound QualityAs I said from the start, I was more or less expecting decent quality from the MX400s; nothing spectacular nor particularly bad. What I did not expect was to be blown away by the sound of the MX400s but, here I am. These are, quite easily, the best sounding earbuds I\'ve ever heard and to explain why, I\'ll start at the bottom.The way the MX400s present bass is very polite and controlled. It\'s punchy enough to make itself known when it needs to be and never rises up unnecessarily. Speed is certainly a strong suit of the MX400s and can come and go quite easily. Perhaps that is the Achilles\' heel of the low end presentation because it doesn\'t seem to have realistic levels of decay and once bass has hit, it seems to disappear just as quickly. These can definitely be described as bass light overall but that can be augmented with a warm sounding amp or even a cheap Fiio E3.The midrange brings to the table nice detail and transparency. Vocals take center stage in the presentation, seeming to sit in front of the instruments. Treble is very smooth and somewhat laid back, lacking the type of sparkle and crispness that I\'ve grown to enjoy from IEMs such as the RE0.The soundstage is what wowed me the most about the MX400s. Both width and depth are very impressive and created an ""out of head"" feeling, as if the music was coming at me from outside of the earbuds themselves. Due to the large soundstage, the MX400s are adept at presenting distance between instruments, and good at spatial positioning within the soundscape. The best aspect of the soundstage is that it\'s large without being too large. I never got the sense that I was disconnected from the music; on the contrary, the MX400s were surprisingly intimate with most tracks.I did find that there\'s noticeable graininess and dryness throughout the presentation. This is perhaps the biggest flaw of the MX400s. Notes are harder and edgier than I prefer and while this may be a bit of a drawback to me, some users may enjoy this for certain Hard Rock or Metal tracks. In addition to this graininess, the MX400s have a somewhat cold, almost analytical, sound about them which is decently resolving but not the most natural or ""musical"" sounding.ConclusionThe MX400s are the best purchase I\'ve ever made in terms of earbuds, blowing all of the other earbuds I\'ve tried (which isn\'t much, admittedly) out of the water. Sure, these have their flaws but given my relatively low expectations, I\'m very pleased with these earbuds. Considering that these are several years old and have since been replaced by the slightly higher end MX580s and Sennheiser\'s new ""Expression"" line of earbuds, I\'m confident that sound quality will only improve as you move up the ladder. Personally, I\'m more of a fan of IEMs than earbuds for a number of reasons but if I were currently in the market for a new pair of earbuds, I\'d definitely start with Sennheiser\'s.Nonetheless, the MX400s have delivered on everything I wanted them to. They sound better than decent, were extremely cheap and I don\'t have to worry about babying them too much. The MX400s can be found online for cheap and I can definitely recommend them to people who need a cheap knock around pair of earbuds.',)"

"(""This is one of those purchases that will change your (tv viewing) life.  This package arrived very quickly and was easy to set-up .... about 30 minutes including the call to start the service.  Basic service started immediately, but some features began the next day because they needed the daily TiVo dial-update (which takes place at 4:22 am or some such thing).The hardware is incredible.  We will never watch television the same way!  We are constantly getting up to retrieve our two-year old from climbing furniture or rescuing cat from same.  That used to mean one or both of us missed a lot of the shows we were purportedly watching.  Also, we would have several VHS tapes we'd be trying to keep track of -- one with kids' shows, one halfway through with shows we'd recorded while on vacation, a couple with shows we'd recorded but weren't sure if we'd watched them already or not.  Nothing labelled because all of it was temporary.That is over.  With the 30-minute buffer, if we need to do something fast we just get up and go (most useful for the toddler climbing furniture scenario) and when we come back we press the Reverse button and catch up with what we've missed.  Or, if the cat is being chased, we can take the time to Pause the show before we jump up.  And the instant replay feature has already gotten a lot of use at our house now that the NCAA basketball season has begun.  IT'S AWESOME.  We've also set up the system to record our favorite shows during the week, so now we don't even worry about what day or time it is.  Setting up to record a single show is fairly standard; setting the system up to record a show whenever it's on is *very* easy -- no plugging in days and dates and times -- just find the show alphabetically, highlight it, and press the Select button (though this has been problematic with some cable shows, which replay shows multiple times).  Then we sit down when we are ready, check the Now Playing list (which shows what has already been recorded for you), and watch whatever we want to watch.  And we skip right past all the commercials.  It's very liberating.The TiVo layout of the simulated keyboard (for entering keywords) is better than on DirecTV.On the down side,  we'd had an RCA DirecTV receiver before this and preferred their online software and the remote.  Well, *I* preferred that remote.  My husband likes the Philips remote because it is smaller.  I contend that this remote is more confusing -- with fewer buttons to work with, sometimes you have to go through a series of menus to find a feature instead of just pushing one button.  As with other software differences between the two systems, sometimes it is just a matter of taste.  But sometimes they are easily quantifiable; for example, with DirecTV we could define 5 user lists and could access these lists with one button -- when I was looking for kids' shows I pressed a couple of buttons and then kids shows I had selected were the only ones that showed up on the grid.  My personal list had movie channels and news shows, my husband's had a lot of sports and travel shows, etc.  TiVo gives you ONE list to customize.  Yikes.  Also, menus are not wrap-around.  And sometimes buttons are context-dependent, so they do one thing in one type of menu but something else if you're watching live tv, for example.  In addition, it would be nice to have some tally of what amount of time is already stored.  In other words, the software needs work.  This is one of those times when you wish a focus group *had* been brought in.We tried having the system record things based on what it thought we would like, but found some truly odd shows using up our 35-hour drive, and so have turned that feature off for now.  Overall, the system is very powerful but the user interface is clunky.  That isn't a dealbreaker, but it *is* curious.I give this receiver 4 stars: 5 for the TiVo service, 3 for the TiVo 2.0 software.  The monthly (or, if you choose, one-time) fee for TiVo service is quite reasonable.  We have been using this component for about a month and, with some slight reservations about software, think it's fantastic.Highly recommended."",)"
"(""This is just a great product. I've had directv for a couple years, so I'm going to focus on what tivo added when I replaced my old receiver with this one:(1) the ability to interrupt live programming without missing anything. Say you're watching a show, and you get a phone call. Just pause (it is always recording what you're watching), complete your call and then resume.(2) No wrong tape/missing tape/wrong tape speed/over-record problems. A problem with VCR recording is making sure the tape is in and set up properly. It's a nuisance at best, and can cause the recording to mis-fire completely at worst.(3) Leave town and record. If you need to leave town for a few days or a week, you can still record the shows you want without having to worry about tape capacity.(4) Record by program rather than time/channel/code.(5) Multiple search options for locating programs of interest. Title, description, cast names, category are all options. You can locate programs easily, two weeks in advance (no hunting through program grids).(6) Season pass. Once you find a program of interest, if it is recurring, you can subscribe by &quot;season-pass&quot;, which will record all the episodes of a show (and you can choose first-run only if you want) even if it changes time, day, or length.(7) Watch-while-recording. If you are recording a show, you don't have to wait until it is over before you can start watching it. Suppose there is a show you want to watch that starts at 10:00. Just show up at 10:20, and you can start watching from the beginning, skip the commercials, and still finish at 11:00.(8) Manage old recordings. If you've got a significant amount of back-logged recording, managing it with tape is a mess: which tapes have what on them, avoiding over-recording, finding the programs, etc. With this device, however, you have 35 hours available by title presented in a simple menu. To be sure, you can't permanently archive this way, but if you want to it will play to VCR for you - without your having to make sure you get clean, labeled tapes set up in real-time.(9) Quality. Because you're capturing the over-the-air pre-compressed signal, the recorded version is as good as the live version. This is a significant advantage that this has over the standard tivo.(10) Easy to set-up. I already had my dish set up, so this wasn't difficult - the only thing was that the regular directtv people don't know all the steps on transferring my account from my old receiver over to the tivo box, but they have dedicated support people who know what to do.Overall, this is just a very wonderfully well thought-through product. There were quite a few times when I first got it when I thought of something that would be convenient if it would do for me, and each time there was a way to do it."",)"

"('I\'m a drummer and have been involved with music - in some form or fashion - for more than 40 years. One of my current gigs involves playing a drumset enclosed within a sound booth. Isolation headphones are an absolute necessity in this setting. My old headphones were well worn and I did do a good bit of research for a replacement pair. Most ""pro"" studio headphones are $150+ and I didn\'t want to drop that much for them. When I saw the Koss QZ-99\'s, read the reviews (most of which were good), and saw the price (forty bucks even - shipped - on Ebay)- I decided to give them a try. Well, they are rather suitable for my purposes - they do a fair job cutting the background noise - are decently constructed with metal supports rather than the soon-broken plastic used on most of today\'s headphones - and will probably hold up well. They fit snuggly - perhaps just a bit too snuggly - but, again, that is desirable for my purposes. I don\'t want them flying off while I\'m playing. So - they do fill a need for me - and relatively inexpensively compared to most other options.Now for the bad news - the sound quality from these headphones is mediocre at best and they can be uncomfortable to wear. Bass response is very poor - and if you try to accentuate the bass, you\'ll get an annoying rattle in both earpieces. Since the sound elements can\'t keep up, I really don\'t believe they would hold up long with boosted-bass settings. The treble also seems just a bit clipped... I\'d characterize the sound as slightly ""muddy"" in general. These are by no means ""audiophile"" quality headphones - I\'ve had inexpensive headphones from discount stores that could easily match - and, in some cases, exceed - the sound quality of the Koss QZ-99\'s. Almost all but the smallest heads out there will probably find them too tight (and a bit too heavy) for prolonged wearing without discomfort. As the Amazon description states - these might be ""ideal for use with racing scanners and metal detectors"" - but they are by no means for the casual and comfortable listening of music.One thing that seriously disturbs me reading some of the other reviews here is how often these are promoted for use when using power tools and equipment. By no means should you be listening to music - or other audio sources - while operating chainsaws, mowers, power saws, etc. Doing such is simply beyond stupid and can be quite dangerous to you - and to those around you. Certainly you should make every effort to protect your hearing with passive (non-speaker) headphones or earplugs when exposed to loud equipment - but you certainly don\'t need your attention distracted by music.So - I\'m relatively satisfied with these for my intended purposes (studio isolation) and they would likely be a tolerable match for metal detectors and even for scanners on race day. However - if you buy them solely to listen to music and expect to have a pleasant and comfortable experience - you\'re very likely to be very, very disappointed..... and if you plan to use them while operating potentially-dangerous power equipment - you are a complete moron....',)"
"(""This indeed is a fine lens. Excellent construction. Relatively small and discreet (with the lens hood off). Excellent image quality and very sharp. The colors it produces are gorgeous - it may be a subjective thing, but to me it has that certain look that you get from some of the finest L lenses. If you buy it, you will be very pleased.The one negative thing I can say about the lens is that it has less than stellar flare control. More than my other lenses, this lens is susceptible to washed out images if the sun is in the wrong spot. It is at times frustrating if you can't work around. It is a bit of an issue, but I wouldn't consider it serious enough that you should avoid this lens for this reason. I would give this lens a 4 1/2 stars, but Amazon forces me to take off a whole star.Once micro-adjusted on you camera, it is very sharp. I used this thing on both 5d mark ii and Rebel T2i. I found that on 2ti, while creating beautiful images, it was always slightly out of focus (evident only when you pixel peeped). On the 5d mk ii on the other hand, it is perfect, but as I said, had to be adjusted. I suspect that my copy needs to be calibrated. Make sure that you test it out if you don't the option to adjust in your camera. This issue can be easily fixed on the 5d mk ii.I don't think it is fair to reduce the rating because the lens a prime or that it is not a zoom and therefore not as versatile. That's the type of lens that it is. If it doesn't suit you, don't buy it. While primes have much better IQ than zooms, I understand that is not the case when it comes to Canon L tele zooms such as 70-200 2.8 ii. In terms of IQ, there would be no advantage to getting this prime. However, the pros of the 200L prime is that it is much smaller, it's black and more discreet and significantly cheaper.Lack of IS is not really an issue on a full frame camera where you can crank up the ISO a bit in lower light situations. At 2.8, this lens is reasonably fast to shoot hand held in daylight. I've used it hand held indoors where there was a lot of light and I had no issues whatsoever.This lens is quite versatile. It's wonderful for portrait and landscape photography. It would make a great sports lens I suppose, but I've never used it for that purpose. If you have kids, this will probably be your go to lens. I doubt that this lens is suitable for wildlife, as it just doesn't reach far enough for that purpose.I have one final suggestion to those contemplating purchasing this lens. I find that I love owning the lens, but I use it the least. Consider if you need this focal length. If your longest lens is a 50mm or 80mm, you may find that a 100mm or 135mm is a more versatile focal length."",)"

"(""The Vista is all around good unit. It does have it's short comings, but in general is one of the best hand GPS unit out there.The problem with small hand GPS units are usually: Lack of memory, lack of battery life and poor screen resolutions.The Vista does not have the memory size problems. At 24 Megabytes of memory you can store a large amount of maps. In my case, I uploaded all of California, Washington and large chunks of Oregon in high detail and still had room left over.The screen resolution is not bad. You might think it is a bit small, but this is a hand unit, not a dashboard car unit that has the luxuary of surface area. They can not make the screen any larger without making the whole unit larger. The pixel count is also fairly large making the images on the screen pretty crisp.The battery life is also not that bad. If you turn on all the features of the unit, you can drain the 2 AA batteries in about 8 or 9 hours. If you turn on the power saver mode and turn off other features you can live without, you can get about 15 or 16 hours of use out of the unit. I do not think that is too bad, but it might annoy you. To me, it is not a big deal since I have rechargable batteries and regular batteries are cheap and easy to carry.Another nice things about the Vista is that you can navigate all the features of the unit while it is in your left hand. Some people do not like this, but I think it is cool since I can use my left hand pretty well. I notice some people are a bit clumy with their left hand if they are right handed. I have no problems though.The satellite tracking is good. Some people claim it does not track well in deep woods, but since I am urban explorer, I do not have those problems. I guess if you were a hunter, you might see that as a big negitive, but I have a Garmin Vista to keep me out of the deep woods.If you get a Garmin Vista you should also get the carring case to keep it protected, and also get the data/cigarette power adapter cable. When you get into the car you can hook this up and not use the batteriers.You will also need to buy one of the Garmin CDROM maps. They tend to be expensive, but the maps that come with Vista Garmin are really poor and are of no use.The other thing I notice is not with the unit itself, but the company that makes it. Garmin does a very good job of supporting the Vista and it's like brothers (Legend, Trek, Camo). Firmware updates are released often and do fix bugs that crop up. The manual is quite good and very useful. There are a number of websites that are very helpful for the first time GPS owner, so do not worry about support; you'll get it from Garmin or someone else who owns a Garmin.The GoodsSmall sizeGood screen resolutionLarge memoryPlenty of features for the average trekker of any kindBattery life can be long, if managed properlyWater proof, but does not float!Great support from GarminSmall sizeThe BadsThe maps that comes with it are worthlessBattery life can be poor if not managed properlySatellite tracking might be bad under heavy tree cover"",)"
"('I\'ve become dependent upon zip disk technology through years of using the older models but found the parallel models tedious to use because of competition for the only printer port, incompatibility with most printer switches and scanner ports, the touchiness of the software and slow performance. This USB model is an amazing upgrade because of its ease of use with Windows XP and the USB ports. I cite particularly the built in support in XP; no need to deal with the cumbersome IOMEGA software. XP will recognize its availability or removal quickly, and can format it as well, leaving no real need for for IomegaWare. I love the fact that it\'s powered by the USB port, obviating the need for an adapter and extra wire. The power requirement is 498mA and the standard USB port delivers 500mA.Compared to backing up files on CD-R there\'s more instant gratification and less media handling to just copy files to the Zip drive, just as I would a hard drive. I develop web sites and want the security of having immediate copies of changed files on a removable medium and this fills the bill adequately. In my view it beats recording on multi-session CD-R\'s, waiting for the CD to finalize, and ... in all, can be a faster process actually.Why the 250MB model? I wanted compatibility with the old 100MB media, and there are plenty of those out there. Otherwise I would have purchased the 750MB Zip for its USB 2.0 capability, but it can only read, not write, 100MB media. I primarily use 250MB media for my own purposes and I\'ve noticed that it seems much faster on this drive than with the 100MB media. I don\'t know why yet.Capacity? All of my web sites and important data folders are much less than 250 MB so that\'s not an issue for me. On a daily basis I backup only the active web sites, my email files, and spreadsheet data. For more voluminous data I use the nicely designed ""Backup My PC"" program from Stomp Software. This used to be the Seagate Backup Exec supplied with Windows 98 as ""MS Backup"". With compression the 250MB media can hold up to 400+ MB, nearing the capacity of a CDROM disc.Performance? I can live with USB1.1 technology though I surely would have preferred 2.0 since my hardware (new Dell) supports it. Using a backup program like I often do, the writes to the Zip drive are kept to a minimum and I can backup/verify a 72MB web site in less than 2 minutes, far exceeding the promised maximum speed of .9Mbps of the USB 1.1 model. Initially the Zip drive ran very slowly and I was quite unhappy with that. Turns out that Windows XP has a setting in Device Manager under the Policies tab to ""Optimize for performance"". That was not being defaulted to. My performance increased 5 to 7-fold with this setting. Also, I was having intermittent media errors which disappeared when I unchecked ""Enable write caching on the disk"", again under ""Policies"".In summary, I consider this USB Zip to be very convenient owing to its strong support from XP, freedom from confining power adapters, and hot plugability (on or off) to the USB port. I also like the Iomega Brand. Most important it offers me compatibility with most other computers I interface with and with acceptable capacity and speed. If you do buy this drive, consider favoring the 250MB media for yourself (performance, as well as capacity) and the 100MB for compatibility with others (if this applies to you).Hope this information proves useful and that you find the 250MB Zip to be worth your $$$.',)"

"(""This review about an older camera is to help those who still have their D510, help those who may be looking for a very good used or refurbed older digital as an entry into digital photography without spending alot, and to debunk some of the bunk you will find in comments here due to not reading the full manual on CD. The printed Manual, which would be the one a reader would start with, is close to USELESS. Don't stop with this one. It does not do this great camera justice.First, I have had mine for about 2 years and it is still going strong, even after buying it as a factory refurb. Second, this camera provides the best match on the market between point-and-shoot convenience, small size, and some extended pro's control over resolution, white balance, shutter speed(ISO), focus point, etc. You will have to buy an upscale(read that expensive) camera today to get these options. Third, this camera takes great pictures at just 2.1 Megabit, and you really don't need more  han this if you don't plan to print photos larger than 8 x 10.Now here are tips for using this camera and some for useful for Digital Photography in general:1.The settings you change ARE retained after power off, but you have to SET this option. Open the lense for picture taking, push OK button to enter Setup screen, follow the Manual instructions to change the default settings to what you want, now set the RESET option to HOLD in the SET options screen. Don't forget once set they will be retained until you RESET defaults back to D510's originals, which means if you HOLD defaults to a low resolution say in order to get more pics on the 8Meg mem card supplied, and forget to change it before taking a pic needing higher resolution, you just lost it. This is why D510 is defaulted to HQ, the setting required for photo quality 5x7's.I leave resolution to HQ and use a bigger 64Meg mem card. I change the Digital Zoom default from OFF to ON because so I always get the full range of both Optical and Digital Zoom via the Zoom lever on top. In the ON option, a graphic shows on your LCD in pic taking mode to indicate when you have Zoomed past the Optical(optical does not degrade resolution) and are entering Digital(will begin to reduce resolution of pic). In addition, when you are still in Optical you will here lense motor run. When you are out of Optical and into Digital you will not here motor any longer. Digital zoom only shows in LCD, not Optical View finder, so be sure to frame you shot in the LCD if zooming past the 3X Optical.2. The flash pops up automatically to be sure you don't forget to open it, missing a pic that needed it. To turn it off, just hold down the flash while taking the pic, or use right arrow key to set it to OFF or to set other Flash Options before taking pic.3. BATTERIES. You MUST get 1600 Mah or higher NiMH or NiCAD batteries and charger. ALL digital cameras and toys eat Alkalines and other non-chargeables. Get eight AA so you have a ready set of 4 for backup. You will get great battery life from each recharge, even when using the LCD for viewing your pics and setting(framing) your pic shots. You will not be happy if you don't invest in rechargeables and a larger Memory card.4. You must use an Olympus SmartMedia Card to use the Panorama feature. Since these cost more than generic brands, I use the Olympus 8Meg that came with the camera for Panorama shots and use my generic 64Meg for all others. Note the Digital Panorama is not the same as Analog Panorama. It is not a one shot deal, but more than one shot pieced together in the Cammedia Software supplied. Takes some practice and a MUST READ of the Manual.5. To view your still pics on the LCD push monitor button once, if lense is closed. If lense is open, press twice in quick succession. Press again to quit. To set view/play movie options, close lense and press monitor, then press OK. To set Pic taking options, open lense and press OK. Use arrow keys to navigate to options and OK to set an option change.6. The quality of you pics have as much or more to due with lighting and the stillness at which you hold the camera, than the resolution(mega pixels) you choose. A digital camera takes longer to take a picture than an Analog, and even more time in low light, no flash, zoomed, and high resolutions settings. One could write a book here, and there are some. Read up so you will be happy and not blame the camera for limitations you should be aware of before changing to Digital Photography. The keys one are, in order of priority; frame your shot in the viewfinder when possible with focus frame centered on non-bright area like persons face, not a white shirt, hold the shot button down half way till a green light tells you it has focused. Hold camera very steady 1 sec before and 1 second after pic is taken. Squeeze pic button between index on top and thumb or other finger(s) on bottom of camera. Don't just push on top because like a rifle shot, if you pull the trigger your barrel will move. If you slowly squeeze it, it will not move.More steadiness time is needed for low light, flash OFF, zoomed and high resolution(megapixels) shots. If you pic is somewhat blurry it is likely you and not the camera. Newer digitals have Digital Stabilization to mitigate some movement during pic taking.Finally, the D510 is an awesome and reliable camera. It deserves a 5, but the stupid manual and some un-intuitive menu labeling and navigation has reduced it to a 4. I would highly recommend it as a low cost camera for anyone who wants a digital but don't want to spring for an unknown new one at high cost. You will have to pay over $300 for a camera with the pic taking options and control this one gives you."",)"
"(""This is my second digital camera.  My first was the Olympus 340R which is still near perfect after 3 years of use.  I do a lot of outdoor photography and needed something with zoom capability.The pixels wasn't that big of a concern because the 1.3 mp of the 340R was suiting me just fine.  I run my 19&quot; montitor's resloution at 1600x1200 and the picture fills up the screen with awesome quality.The zoom on this camera is amazing.  It can take a picture of 8 pt text on paper from across the room (11 feet) and you can read it clearly.  It's also pretty amazing how lighting is composed.  Without the flash on, it still compensates for a lot of light.  I was able to zoom across the neighborhood for about 1500 feet at night and still get a good picture of cars coming down a hill.With my old camera I found that digital zoom is pretty much worthless unless you print straight from the card.  If you need the extra zoom, you can do it on your computer.  I tested this out:  I took a 27X zoomed picture and a 10X optical zoom of the exact same object.  On my computer I enlarged the optical zoom photo 300%. The detail was exactly the same in both photos.  When you only use optical zoom, you also get more overall picture.  What I mean my this is that you get more frame area to crop out if you need to, abling you to center the object easier.One feature that no one has mentioned yet is the ability to record 4 seconds of audio with each photo.  I find this really cool to mark my GPS location points.  I mark the position on my GPS, take the picture, and then record what GPS waypoint the picture is of.  The 4 second audio is only 32K on the card, so you won't even notice loss of space.  You can even go back and re-record or add audio to pictures already taken.When you play back the photos while connected to a TV, the audio plays with each photo.The stability is somewhat of an issue when zommed in, but I also found the &quot;action&quot; mode to elimate any bluring.A lot have mentioned the &quot;lens cap of doom&quot;.  It doesn't pop off the lense, it's held by a thumb spring. (mabe the older ones did just snap onto the lense, but my new one doesn't) It also comes with a retaining cord so it's no going anywhere.  The camera didn't have a specific place to attach the lens cap cord, so I wove it into the neck strap.  It's long enough that it doesn't stop the lens from pertruding out when turned on and you forget to take the lens cap off.Viewing taken photos on the LCD is very quick.  My 340R would take about 3 seconds to load each photo in to the LCD.  The C-700 is almost immediate, and you can zoom in 3X and pan freely around the photo.  After taking a picture, you can also view the last shot immediately and delete it if you want.  To do this, press the LCD button [] twice quickly.  I use feature this a lot because I like to show people the photo/video right away.The last feature I absolutely love is the USB connection.  I have a FlashPath (floppy disk reader) for my old camera, which won't be getting much use anymore.  The USB is pretty much as fast a reading from a hard drive.  A 4 meg video clip starts playing immediately straight from the camera."",)"

"('I bought this camera in August 2001, and couldn\'t possibly be happier.  This is truly a great camera.  I\'m glad I did my research.RECHARGEABLE BATTERY. After watching my old roommate\'s camera eat through AA\'s like you wouldn\'t believe, I decided any camera would have to have a rechargeable battery.  The Elph\'s battery is a tiny little lightweight powerhouse. Charges in 3hours, for me will take about 100 pictures before requiring a recharge. And the battery is memory-free, so you can charge it up halfway if you like. The unit comes with a recharger, which is the size of the camera and plugs directly into a wall socket - very compact.SIZE. This is truly incredible. It will honestly fit in your shirt pocket .  This makes it very easy to have around at social events - in contrast to the clunky Nikon, which would\'ve been my next choice if not for its shape.MEMORY. Uses compact flash; the box says up to 128MB; I\'m using a 256MB without problem. At highest resolution and quality, that comes out to about 300 or so photos on one card. Only drawback is you have to use jpg.FEATURES. Manual controls for some settings.  Takes AVI movies - only about 10 seconds or so at a time in my experience, but enough to get some quick clips.  (Sound quality is average.) ""Photostitch"" - basically lets you take panoramic photos.  You take one photo, and that photo appears in the left side of the LCD, and your new viewfinder is the right half of the screen.  You can do this serially, taking a whole 360 degree panel if you want. The included software merges the pics flawlessly. I got some spectacular panoramas in the mountains. Durable - camera performed in subzero temperatures in the mountains. (Not that I\'d recommend going outside the manufacturers specs, but I took my chances and was rewarded with some great pics.)SOFTWARE.  I can only vouch for the mac software, but it\'s fairly feature packed and easy to use.  Different apps for photostitch, photo management, and video compositing.  A little over-GUI\'d, but good nonetheless.CONNECTIONS. Also included are a usb and video cable. The video cable is great for displaying your photos on TV when you\'re on the road.Only one gripe thus far- for whatever reason, it takes a moment to shoot after you press the button. This makes action shots harder. But overall, it\'s an amazing camera.',)"
"('I didn\'t expect this lens to be so astonishingly good.I\'ve read all the reviews and all the tests, and I\'ve used my share of older Nikon AF and AF-D lenses, and I expected a performance from this lens along the lines of what I\'d experienced with other, similar lenses - just with the addition of the legendary bokeh that everybody seems to buy it for and the giant fast aperture.Instead what I got is a lens that exceeds its spec sheet, exceeds the performance implied by every formal test I\'ve ever seen of it, and exceeds nearly every expectation I had for it.Here\'s why:Any lens will tend to lose acuity as larger apertures are used.  This is due to spherical aberration and occurs to very different degrees in different lenses, but occurs to some degree in every lens.  Tests of this lens show this loss of acuity to a similar degree to that which occurs in its smaller f/1.8 sibling, which I found to be mediocre wide open, and to most of Nikon\'s older AF and AF-D primes, the performance capabilities of which I\'m also familiar with and not always particularly impressed by.Yet while those other lenses are indeed diminished in terms of image quality as their wide-open aperture is approached, the 85/1.4 doesn\'t seem to lose a thing in terms of the visual impact of its images no matter how wide it\'s opened up.  Even wide-full-open at f/1.4, this lens gives stunning images with excellent sharpness, excellent contrast, and beautiful colors that leap right out of the image in full three-dimensional glory.The reason, I suspect, has to do with the fact that the perception of sharpness in an image is not at all the same thing as pure optical acuity.  Acuity is the element effectively measured by performance tests, which look at the loss of contrast on a tiny scale barely resolvable by a digital sensor.  Quite different is what our eyes perceive when we look at an image.  The ""snap"" we find striking when looking at a stunning photo has to do with color and contrast on a somewhat larger scale, and also with other factors in the image as a whole, such as the contrast between in-focus and out-of-focus parts of the image.  Under close inspection at full magnification, it is clear that this lens, like any other, loses acuity at very large apertures.  The overall color and contrast, though, the snap and pop that makes images look vibrant, alive and three-dimensional, does not diminish.  That is extraordinary in an f/1.4 lens.  It means that I can take a photograph of a colorful, detailed subject with this lens at f/1.4, and with another excellent lens at f/5.6, and the image made by this lens will have at least as much of those qualities, even viewed with moderate magnification, as the f/5.6 image will have.  That is the reason this lens deserves its legendary reputation.Of course, that f/1.4 image will also have the beautiful bokeh that this lens is famous for, and it will have a degree of de-focus (not the same as bokeh, which is the QUALITY of the de-focus) that can make the background meld into a soft blur of color mere inches from the plane of perfect focus.  That of course is also what this lens is legendary for.  Many lenses can create de-focus, though: wider, slower lenses can do it close-up, and longer, slower lenses can do it at similar distances - and some, to my eyes at least, have bokeh that is just as nice as the 85/1.4.  What makes this lens remarkable is the combination of those qualities: excellent quality of bokeh, degree of blur controllable all the way to extreme at f/1.4, and a rendering of the in-focus part of the image that is just superb, and that loses not one whit of perceived quality even at wide-open aperture.  That is a combination that will let you make magic.It is not perfect.  This lens\' biggest optical flaw is something that is most commonly called purple fringing.  This is a chromatic aberration that occurs in out-of-focus contrast transitions and can also, I believe, be called longitudinal chromatic aberration.  It occurs because different wavelengths of light are focused slightly differently as they pass through the various lens elements, and it is very noticeable in certain types of images if you look closely.  The lens is also susceptible to flare, so it\'s important to take care to shade the front element, if possible, when shooting into backlit scenes.  These qualities do affect the usability of the lens to a degree, but this lens is a rather specialized tool, and knowing when to use it, and how to use it properly, should be considered a reasonable requirement for anybody who wishes to benefit from its extraordinary capabilities.Perfection is one way to greatness, and there are lenses out there that come close to perfection without being extraordinary in any particular way.  Some of those lenses are deserving of five-star ratings.  This lens does the exact opposite, being extraordinary despite significant imperfections, and I give it five stars as well.  It is utterly unmatched, probably by a wide margin, and probably at any price, at doing what it does well. Regardless of its relatively minor imperfections it is, with a capital ""G,"" one of the Great Nikon lenses.Notes:- This lens has a near complete lack of any of the latest Nikon buzzword tech: there are no ED elements and no aspherical elements, it does not have Nikon\'s close-ratio correction (CRC) floating-element design, and of course it does not have AF-S focusing.  It could probably benefit from all of those things, the first two of which would no doubt help with its issues with chromatic aberration.  It does, however, have Nikon\'s excellent ""SIC"" lens coating, which I suspect is responsible, along with a good overall optical design, for its excellent performance in terms of contrast and color rendition, especially wide-open.  Having fewer elements than the complex zooms no doubt helps as well, as each air/glass and glass/glass interface causes some attenuation in lens performance.  The complex zooms with multiple ED and aspheric elements seem to need those tricks, while this lens gets by without them.- Compared to the 85mm f/1.8D:  In my humble opinion, there is no comparison.  This lens suffers from none of the 1.8 lens\' relative lack of contrast in comparison to Nikon\'s newer lenses: in fact just the opposite - it seems, if it\'s possible, even contrastier and more vibrant in its rendition of colors than even the best of them.  That alone gives its images a subtle, but noticeable, bump in quality compared to the f/1.8.  This lens\' wide-aperture shots don\'t lose the punch that the 1.8D\'s do.  And while I didn\'t personally find the 1.8D\'s bokeh to be particularly nice, this 1.4D does certainly live up to its reputation in that area, being equal to the very best.  Even if you never shot this lens wider than f/1.8 it would be twice the lens the 85/1.8 is.  These differences are modest but not small, and they show up in every image.  The difference between greatness and competence is often subtle.  Here, to my eyes, it is nevertheless very clear.- This lens uses 77mm filters, which is very handy for most Nikon users as that has been the standard pro filter size for twenty years or so now.  To get the most out of this lens you will really need to invest in at least one high-quality neutral density filter of 2-3 stops.  This will allow you to shoot the lens in brighter conditions and still benefit from its control over depth of field.  I have two 2-stop ND filters and sometimes use both of them together, which the lens handles well, although focusing can become difficult.  Another good investment might be a very high-grade, multi-coated protective filter, which can be helpful in diminishing the flare that this lens can suffer from.  I recommend Hoya\'s excellent ""HD"" filters, the best I\'ve used at helping to control flare.- Focus is very accurate on my sample.  That is a very important consideration for a lens with such a narrow wide-open depth of field, and I\'ve had more than one fast lens whose wide open performance was effectively ruined by inconsistent focus.  While this is not an AF-S lens and consequently lacks the subtle, incremental ability to track motion that AF-S lenses tend to have, it is extremely good for still shots even at f/1.4.',)"

Unfortunately, this diminuitive little terror was too much for my poor system and it finally gave up the ghost.I bought the Netgear MR814 router and two of these MA101 adapters; one for my Win98 system and another for my WinXP system.  I will say the router installed without a hitch.  These things on the other hand are junk, to put it mildly, and the tech support staff were about as helpful as a blindfold.First off, the Win98 system just could not recognize the device upon startup.  It would show up in the device manager but as disabled.  The only way to get it working was to remove the device, reinstall it, and reconnect to the network every time I started the computer.  Even this process was slow and annoying, taking well over two minutes while the system hangs and tries to figure out what this foreign object is.  Based on the other reviews here, you will note that I\'m not the only reviewer that has had this problem.Tech support?  Well, this can take anywhere from five to forty-five minutes and, assuming you\'re not hung up on, you might as well start dialing the instant you have problems.  Reason?  Even though I told the techs repeatedly that I\'ve done all the ""basic"" troubleshooting like removing and reinstalling drivers, removing, unplugging, and reinstalling the device, etc... they make you go through the entire process anyway.  After three separate calls, totalling an hour and a half of hold time and another hour and a half of reinstalling things, the best the tech could say was ""reinstall Windows.""  This is techspeak for ""I have no clue.""  Against my better judgement, I did it anyway except Windows messed up the reinstall.  One computer dead, one to go.I\'m ""happy"" to report the WinXP computer did install the device but there was just one slight problem.  It could recognize the network and even saw the router\'s SSID, but it would not connect to it.  Here we go again.  After two different phone calls, and a lot of inane disconnecting and reconnecting, the best the techs could tell me was it was due to interference.  Strange, considering my other computer could recognize the network fine before meeting its untimely death and it\'s the same distance from the router.  Again, techspeak for ""I have no clue.""  Ironically, I did manage to get it to work after I hung up on the tech.  Don\'t ask me how because I really don\'t know.So now, after the added expense of a Windows XP ""upgrade"" and the loss of an entire weekend, I have my network set up.  One final problem.  If I try any WEP encryption keys, I will lose the connections on both computers.  I was able to get the router to allow access to these two computers only. Assuming this actually works, that should be secure enough, but I\'m still not too keen about all my data passing back and forth unencrypted.Hopefully this review will convince you to look elsewhere.',)"
"(""Very Sharp Lens! Love it! too bad I have to return it.It actually really good lens, really sharp picture, the problem is... my Old Nikon D40 can't make the auto-focus works, it doesn't have in-body auto focus, see.. in the real world.. where my wife and kids and friends will eventually hold the camera and take my pictures, not just me taking their pictures, they don't know how to focus it manually. and that means all pictures where me in it could be useless blurry memories, so with my heart broken I have to return this lens,.. for the sake of me."",)"
"(""In September 2009, I bought a Nikon D3000, my first SLR.  I am an avid amateur photographer, and was incredibly excited about my new purchase.  My best friend is a great photographer and bought me this lens, telling me that the lenses that came with the camera were junk.Well, I'm pleased with the lenses that came with the camera, but they don't hold a candle to this one.  I'm consistently impressed with the stunning pictures that I get with this lens.  I've used it for just about everything I've taken pictures of, along with the automatic lens that came with the package.  When comparing the same pictures from the two different lenses, this one wins every time.I'm still learning to get it in focus every time I use it, and I'm not great with action shots with it yet, but it's a great lens for a new SLR user."",)"

"('If you have a camera with a built-in autofocus-motor (D90, etc...), then you need this lens.  Everyone should have a 50mm f/1.8 (or faster) lens.  This lens is just too inexpensive and too good to pass up.You buy this lens for two reasons: to shoot in low light without flash or to get great depth of field control.  With a wide aperture of f/1.8 you are guaranteed to get great natural light pictures indoors or other low light situations while maintaining a relatively low ISO.  The other advantage to large apertures is of course the great isolation of your subject by limiting depth of field.  The sample images posted by reviewers show how well this lens works on both accounts.I see reviews complaining about the sharpness of this lens.  Forget about it.  Sharpness is rarely a result of the lens.  I\'ve taken incredibly sharp pictures with this lens and very fuzzy pictures.  Every fuzzy picture was because of something I did ""wrong"", for example...Depth of Field: With f/1.8 at 50mm if you\'re framing a close subject that is only 2 feet away, your depth of field (amount of subject in focus) is only .38 inches (&lt; 1 cm).  That is what is referred to as ""paper thin"" depth of field.  Naturally with such a small amount of the subject in focus much of the image will be ""unsharp"".  This is expected and called bokeh.  Be sure to understand how depth of field works, or make sure to shoot all your subjects from very far away (not recommended).  If this is your first prime lens, then consider the 35mm f/1.8 which has a much more forgiving DOF (.8 inches at 2 feet when wide open).Subject Motion: With such a limited depth of field, when shooting at the larger apertures, even a small bit of subject motion can cause one of two things to happen.  The first is that the part of the subject you wanted to be in focus moved and is now out of focus.  The second is that the shutter speed wasn\'t fast enough to freeze the subject and motion blur occurs.  Make sure to shoot moving subjects with an appropriately high shutter speed.  Here is where your Nikon beats all other DSLRs: you can customize this using Auto ISO in your camera menu.Camera Shake: If you let your camera decide everything for you then eventually your shutter speed is going to drop to a value where you can no longer hold the camera steady enough to get a clear shot without a tripod.  You need to always shoot at a speed that you can hold the camera steady at.  Customize Auto ISO here as well based on your capabilities.Focus Errors: With paper thin depth of field at the wider apertures it\'s even easier for a focus error to ruin a picture.  If you\'re taking a close-up picture of someone\'s face, and your camera selects the nearest object to focus on, then their nose will be in focus but their eyes slightly blurry.  That will ruin your picture.  Even being slightly off will wreck a great picture.  Be very careful with your choice of focus method.  If you\'re shooting at the wider apertures, but not at the nearest object, you may want to use selective auto-focus.  Try to focus on the eyes if you\'re taking pictures of people.It\'s easy to see how the challenges of shooting at wide apertures have more to do with the sharpness of pictures than any optical quality of the lens.  It is challenging, but the great pictures you get are well worth the effort.After the first year I owned this lens my photography education was greatly accelerated.  I was immediately challenged to understand and master depth of field, shutter speed, ISO, and auto-focus.  Without it, I would have continued to do the same dumb things that resulted in mediocre and blurred pictures.  I would have continued to blame the tools (camera, lens, flash, etc...) instead of taking control for myself.If you\'re afraid to walk, then don\'t get this lens.  The only way you\'re going to get proper depth of field and good framing is by walking closer to or farther away from your subject.If you don\'t have a camera with a built in autofocus-motor (D40, D40X, D60, D3000, D3100, or D5000), then you will either need to get the more expensive50mm f/1.4with the autofocus-motor or, if this is your first prime lens and you want a lower price, go ahead and start with the more forgiving35mm f/1.8.',)"
"('UPDATE -  03/19/12Well I called it.  After only a few months of light use, The autofocus will not work.  Stopped midway through a band performance.  My guess is the distance chip is FUBAR because you can hear it try to move but it simply sticks to close or infinity focus, no matter what body I put it on.  Obviously manual focus is fine.  I had my doubts on the durability when it came out of the box and it\'s painful to be right.  Off to NPS...**********I love the 50mm focal length on 35mm cameras.  The DX format in past years kind of ruined the beautiful perspective of the 50 and corralled it far too tight and nerfed the wonderful depth of field flexibility.  A lot of people think the 50 to be a portrait or ""starter"" lens, but that couldn\'t be further from the truth.  In the right hands, the 50 is a killer tool and a righteously sharp piece of glass and it\'s no wonder why Nikon still makes them.  If the 45mm P wasn\'t so over priced and geared toward rich collectors, that would be my weapon of choice.  But, considering the value, sharpness and speed a good 50 is too attractive to pass up.I simply despise midrange 24-70mm zooms and my ancient 1.8 D finally took one beating too many so I upped for the 1.4 to replace it.  The optics are excellent and I take issue with any jabs of softness @ F/1.4.  Sure if you crop into the image 10 times it will start to get fuzzy, but so do electrons when you look at them close enough.  When focus is accurate and the image is viewed normally, this thing is sharp as they come.  In fact, it is sharper at every aperture than the chunky and pricey 17-35mm 2.8 I use for work every day.Why choose 1.4 over the 1.8?  I\'ve shot with the 1.8 in AI and AF-D guises for ages, so this is a good question.  These days it isn\'t as important to have ultra fast glass with the D700 and D3 being so good at high ISO, but in photojournalism if you shoot night crime scenes or in unpredictable environments, the wider aperture does pay for itself.  I know there\'s a bunch of bokeh whores out there dying to hear the wonders of what 1.4 looks like, and sure backgrounds render nicely, but call me crazy, I\'m more interested in the subject actually in focus in my images than the wax paper background. For info on how the lens works shooting a studio swatch or brick walls read elsewhere for a thorough perspective on that sort of useless info.  If you are interested in a flexible focal length with few compromises, aside from Canon\'s beastly, outrageously priced and laughably slow 1.2 L, a 50 - any 50 - is a lens that can do almost anything.Why didn\'t I just buy the new AF-S G lens?  I need something with an aperture ring I can use on my F3 when I shoot black and white film and the G only works on newer bodies.  Focus?  AF-S focus really isn\'t all that important on shorter lenses, it is a technology that is nice, but is far better suited to longer focal lengths when tracking motion in tight compositions.  Focus is fast and accurate on my D700 and the manual focus action on the F3 is silky smooth, though not as solid feeling as the older AI-S lenses and that leads me to the one big bummer about this iteration of the 1.4.Sadly, the lens is made in China and good part of the lens is plastic just like the cheapie 1.8.  For more than $300 this is unacceptable in a pro lens.  Nikon probably decided to cut corners on this to keep the price down, and I feel for the difficulties they must be going through after the earthquake, but it\'s really disappointing.  The older manual focus lenses are indeed heavy, but they were built to last and solid enough to hammer nails with all day.  I\'m not sure how much this lens can take, but at the very least, it would be suspect to shoot with in the rain.  There are cold winters up here so I\'ll be curious to see how well the focus action is when the temperature drops into the minus.Overall, this is the same excellent optic quality NIkon has built into every 50mm lens they\'ve made, but the build quality itself is suspect.  On DX, it sorta kills the joy of what the lens can be, but on film and FX, it\'s gangbusters.  You can\'t go wrong with the 1.4 D, but it\'s at least $100 overpriced for the plastic.',)"
"(""This review is applicable to the Nikon 80-200 f2.8 (Nikon Model 1986) used in conjunction with a Nikon D300s and D700.  My copy was purchased at a specialty online dealer.I have been using the Nikon 80-200 2.8 for approximately a year now.  After use in a wide variety of situations, my opinion is that it is a suitable economic replacement for the Nikon 70-200 2.8 though you will always lust after the 70-200 f2.8 because that is what Nikon owners do (including me).  This lens will clearly suit the needs of most photographers up to and into the professional ranks.  Most non-professional shooters who choose the 70-200 over the 80-200 will do so for the VR capability without knowing what VR really is or how it works.  VR is for stationary objects under specific conditions, not for sports action like so many people believe.  You cannot also shoot in complete darkness because you have VR- yet another myth for many.  Checkout Thom Hogan's website explaining Nikon VR for more detailed information.The Nikon 80-200 2.8 build quality is like a modern tank.  The mechanics of the lens across the board are very smooth.  Manual focusing is precise and smooth.  The manufacturing process seems precise based on clearances between components of the lens.  Nikon has had years to perfect the lens and it seems they did (it was once the flagship of the lens line).  The lens is definitely big and heavy as expected, but also manageable (but you will not generally carry this lens around without first asking if you really need it).  Weight distribution of the lens is more or less even and I find the lens balances well on a Nikon D300s. The tripod collar, unfortunately, does not come off, which I found a little odd.There are a few minor delineations between the 80-200 2.8, the 70-200 2.8, and some other notable Nikon lenses.  Having used both the 80-200 and 70-200, I can definitely notice a slight difference in focusing speed in favor of the 70-200.  I put the focusing speed of the 80-200 on par with the Nikon 70-300 VR, another lens I absolutely loved for outdoor sports action, even under stadium lights (AF speed was exceptionally fast but not as fast as an AF-S lens of course).  Sure, for another $1,300 or so, you can get the faster focusing speed of the Nikon AF-S 70-200 f2.8, but for most purposes, this is not necessary.  I found no issues with AF accuracy either in real world conditions or testing on a LensCalc.  However, there was some minor vignette on the FX  sensor of the D700 but not the D300s.  This was easily overcome in Lightroom and not really prevalent in most shots anyway.  Note that this performance is across the entire spectrum of focal length and apertures in real world conditions.Lens sharpness beyond f2.8 is very good on my copy of the lens.  At f2.8, it is just a little soft.  Some reviewers noted minor variations of sharpness among other lens copies.  This variance is possible with any lens and was also noted on the more expensive Nikon 70-200 2.8. Color rendition of the 80-200 is superb but just a little cold for my taste and I correct for this in Lightroom as well.In short, this is a great lens even compared to the more expensive Nikon 70-200 f2.8 VRII.  When you factor in cost difference, it comes the winner unless you are really in the upper echelons of professional photography and are able to really leverage every technical difference.  Most users will not be disappointed.  You may want to consider getting theHB-7 Hood for AF 80-200mm f2.8D Lensdesigned specifically for this lens.  It does make a difference under many conditions.  You can also checkout a third-party version, also specirfically designed for this lens, that received very good reviews and is $24 cheaper.

"(""I will start off saying I did not purchase this lens through Amazon. I purchased it through a private owner, hardly never used (looked brand new) with box, case, and even a hood for $700. This is the two-ring AF deal. There are a lot of great used lenses out there!I am also not a professional photographer. I take pictures for fun and occasionally money and barter. This is not a very technical review, there are many on the Internet to read in this regard. This is from a real-world user and observer.I wanted to upgrade my camera to a D700 since prices have come down and I craved one for four years. Previously I have owned a D40 and have a D90 as a DX primary and backup to the D700 now. I needed a good FX lens to add to my collection (I also have the excellent Nikon 50mm AF-S f/1.8 G, a Tokina DX 11-16 which works great on FX at 15-16 mm, and some Tamron lenses) preferably to complement the D700 for low-light kids sports and wildlife. I didn't want to break the bank and go for a $2000+ lens. I didn't care much for sigma lenses. This lens fits my goal nicely!The great things I have noticed about this lens:- Focuses quickly and accurately.- Sharp along the whole focal range.- built like a tank - lots of glass and metal!- nice fixed tripod collar.- Fantastic Bokeh!- constant 2.8 of course!- Cost!!!!!- If it ever breaks (which it probably won't unless maybe if you drop it from a building) you can use it as a boat anchor. Ha Ha just kidding.Some of the cons with this lens (Still a five star lens in my opinion):- HEAVY. Weighs as much or more as my D700 camera. When I switch back to a plastic lens or my Nikon 50mm, it feels like a totally different camera and like a brick has been lifted off! lol.- I would HIGHLY recommend a tripod or monopod for use with this lens. This will help to stabilize the heavy lens and prevent camera share and resulting blur.- You must shoot at a much higher shutter speed and/or ISO and/or wider aperture to balance the no VR option. But I knew this coming in. Monopod will help GREATLY! (poor man's VR lol)- I have noticed some slight vignetting and/or corner light shading when wide open at a few apertures.- My copy will backfocus IF I try to shoot right at where the focus of the lens starts which is around 5 feet. I couldn't figure out why my photos were crap up close and this is why. This is not a macro lens folks! Although there is a macro setting on the aperture ring on the lens, I wouldn't even suggest it. YMMV.I recommend this lens highly. For the cost difference between this and the highly priced 70-200 2.8 VR lenses from Nikon, I would pick this hands down any day. There is a reason this is a five-star lens, and I don't think Nikon makes many almost perfect, built like a tank lenses like this. You may also check other online sources for a great used copy a lot cheaper as I have done. Just get it!I have included a URL link to my Flickr pictures taken with this lens in the comments section, since Amazon doesn't accept it within this body."",)"

"(""Earlier reviews of SONY's MDR-W08 mini-phones describe an in-line volume control. The set I received in January of 2011 doesn't have this extra.Their one-meter wire is the precise length of the cord on the bright yellow phones that came with a SONY Walkman cassette player I bought a quarter century ago, but there's definite design and function differences. Those old phones were metal and plastic; these are only plastic and weigh less. The wire is now a thinner gauge as well, but not by much.The old headphone drivers were more disc shaped and always chafed my ears just a little. These new ones are nicely contoured and fit so much better; no discomfort at all.Audio quality is lusher with these but clearly their response favors low frequencies over high. It's not at all a sacrifice, but if you're looking for phones that will reproduce a dog whistle with no loss of DBs, these aren't for you.I don't recommend the MDR-W08s for anyone who will be moving around while using them, as the wire probably won't take much tugging before shorting out.

"('I\'m using mine with a Sandisk 64meg MMC card.  On the Intel website, there are warnings about certain Sandisk MMC cards.  Mine did not have the model numbers listed on the website, fortunately, and mine worked fine. My 64 meg Sandisk card has completely different model numbers than those listed ...  Mine works fine.  I added lots of songs to the external card, then deleted some (making holes in memory, sometimes a problem with MMC cards), then copied more songs.  I haven\'t had any skipping, and the card reports the proper memory size.With an inexpensive 64meg MMC card, this becomes the lowest cost 128 meg flash MP3 player around.  I have over 1:45 of music, and most of my MP3s are 160kbps, and I still have 12 meg free.The ""cons"" for this unit ...  The buttons are indeed hard to press.  A poor design means when you squeeze the player to change the volume, your other fingers are squeezing the next/previous buttons.  That\'s a poor design.The screen doesn\'t show much information.HOWEVER, that being said, if you plan on putting an mp3 player in your back pocket and just letting it run for 2 hours, This inexpensive player can be easily expanded to 128 (and beyond, if anyone ever makes a 128 meg MMC card), and runs for a decent amount of time on one AA battery.I use my player for working out and skiing.  In both those cases, I turn it on, set it for infinite repeat, and just let it run until the battery stops, or I stop.  For those cases, this is probably the best deal available now.I\'d love to see a flash MP3 player with 256 meg and USB2.0.  But until then, this player really fits the bill.Some more info:  I now own 4 mp3 players, inluding the original Nomad I, 2 cheapo players, and this Intel 3000.  The 3000 is the best, because it works with Windows XP, is USB, holds 128 economically, lasts for 10 hours on a single AA, is small, and does exactly what it\'s supposed to do.  The other players either can only go to 64 meg, the battery lasts 4 hours, they skip songs on the MMC card, etc.  The 3000 finally does what a player should do, and for a good price.The other pluses, again repeating other reviews, include a full license key for Music Match Pro, the software includes both a plug-in for MM to transfer to the player from within MM (my preferred method), as well as a very nice Intel Audio Manager program, which is pretty nice to look at by itself.  (In the MM plugin, you can\'t delete music on the player, so you do that in Intel Audio Manager).  I\'m picky about software, and Intel Audio Manager is well written, with a nice looking interface, and is extremely easy to use (a pleasure to use, actually).The reason the price is so low is that Intel has stopped support and manufacturing of personal gadgets.  It\'s a shame, because I think they did a very professional job...',)"
"('1) Size. Both cameras are small but the crown goes to Olympus, even if only by few cubic points. Olympus is also lighter of the two.2) Resolution. Both cameras feature 4.1Mpixel CCD. What Canon misses and Olympus has is an extrapolation to 3,200 X 2,400 (or 7+Mpixels). By making an extrapolation from a raw image (not even TIFF!) the camera may make a much smarter decision then your average Photoshop program. This is the must if you want to print a poster from your picture.3) Picture quality. Very good and comparable between both cameras. Even the most advanced reviewers have a hard time giving clear advantage to one or the other. Canon has a slightly better rendering algorithm, so the nod goes to Powershot but not by much. ...4) Lenses - for all purposes the same. Not as fast as on any of the bigger cameras but satisfying for most applications.5) Zoom - same.6) Storage media. Olympus uses SmartMedia, while Canon uses CompactFlash (types I and II). Both supply laughable 16Mb out of the box, so you have to purchase larger modules. The prices for memory are comparable but advantage goes to Canon, since Compact Flash is a more advanced format and comes in bigger sizes. Still, 128Mb is more then enough for a day of shooting.7) Batteries. Both cameras are not ideal. Canon pretty much forces you to buy additional module ... since it uses a proprietary format, but Olympus does not supply a rechargeable batteries and does not allow to recharge in camera, so you need to buy NiMh AA batteries and charger, which would cost the same (smart investment). Still I would give an advantage to Olympus because you can always find AA batteries in any store if you ran out of power. I also want to address here the power consumption since a lot of users are giving their thumbs down based on this feature alone. Both cameras are bad. This is a sad reality if you want a subcompact camera. But not make a tragedy out of this. If you use both cameras smartly, it should last you the whole day of shooting quite easily.8) Price. Still too high IMHO for both of cameras. Canon is slightly more expensive but not by much. You can buy any camera now for less [money]. With all accessories (memory, batteries, case, etc.) you should just be able to fit in ... budget.9) Flash. Mediocre at best for both cameras. Canon does a slightly better job at red-eye reduction, but Olympus is slightly better with white-balance adjustment. Still this is probably the weakest point for both cameras.10) Video. Both cameras have built-in video mode with sound recording and speaker for later review. Since I don\'t care much for this feature I won\'t discuss it here.11) Supplied software. Olympus ships with camera the Adobe Photoshop Elements - by far the best photo-editing package on the market now.12) Nice extras. Canon comes in a metal casing which gives it a very sophisticated and ruggish look. Olympus casing is more stylish IMHO and is made of very sturdy plastic. Both cameras have auto USB connectivity and optional waterproof cases. Olympus has three unique features that made me buy it. First is a low-light noise reduction that can be activated when you switch camera into night shot option. The special algorithm that Olympus uses allows it to compensate for long-exposure related errors (such as ""hot"" pixels) and results in a much better looking pictures. If you like to make night photos (I do) you can\'t live without this feature. Second feature is pixel mapping that allows camera to compensate for dead pixels in CCD. Until you have this problem you won\'t probably think much about it. The third feature is ""User Mode"" which allows you to store your preferable settings and access them by simple switch of the dial. I use it quite often and it saves a lot of preparation time before shot is taken and results in a better quality picture. It is especially useful if you take a series of pictures in challenging lighting conditions (such as twilight time).Overall, I chose Olympus for the above mentioned features, but you can\'t go wrong with any of these little cameras.',)"
"(""This was an easy choice for me, because it's currently still the only 20GB player on the market. If, like me, you have lots and lots of music, size matters. As big as this is, I expect I will upgrade in 2-3 years when they have 50-60GB models.If you really like music, this unit will reorganize your life. You can carry around all (well, an awful lot, anyway) of your music, organize it into as many different playlists as you want, and play it pretty much anywhere. Of course, there are also some annoying problems, but don't let that stop you from getting an amazing device like this.The best parts: (1) Sound quality. For all but audiophile equipment, the limitation on sound quality will either be the MP3 file (if it's a low-grade one) or the equipment you play it through (mass-market stereos and headphones, etc). If you hook this up to an expensive audiophile system, you will hear its limitations, but it plays compressed sound files anyway, so that's no surprise. (2) It goes everywhere and hooks up to nearly anything. Having line level out as well as a headphone-out jack adds to its versatility. I use it when I work out or go walking, at work with headphones or through the computer, with my living room stereo through an RCA cable, in the car with a casette adapter, and with the boombox I've got in the kitchen, also with a casette adapter. Having the same set of playlists instantly accessable all of those places is simply amazing. (3) A surprisingly usable interface. I had a flash-based MP3 player a couple of years ago, and based on that, I thought it would be really hard to find and play music amongst hundreds of albums. The interface makes this pretty easy.Things that have bugged me in the 6 weeks I've had this: (1) battery life could definitely be better. I wish it could use lithium-ions. (2) Interfacing with the computer. I'm not in love with the interface of the PC software, the transfer speed is sluggish, and I've had some stability problems, though nothing that renders it unusable. (3) It takes 20-30 seconds to boot up when you turn it on, and sometimes the buttons are kind of slow to react. (4) It's kind of chunky, and heavier than I'd like. (5) It skips a little sometimes when I'm out walking. I'm not a jogger, but if you want to jog with a player, this might not be the one. (6) This may just be me, but I've had some trouble matching it with good headphones. It works great for rock and electronica with the Sony earclips I use for working out, but it sounds really fatiguing when I pair it with my Grado SR-60s at work for listening to jazz and blues. I think I'm going to pair it with a headphone amp from Headroom and try some other headphones (Sennheiser HD570s, AKG K501s, etc.), to see if I can find the right combination.Overall, though, I definitely recommend this player, even though I hope they will do some things to improve it when they come out with their next model. It is an outstanding device, and I would by another in a second if anything ever happened to it."",)"
"(""This is my second digital camera and from what I see thus far this will most likely be my last. I think I've found the perfect digital camera. Check out the positives and negatives with the PowerShot S30.Positives: (where do I begin?)* Made of solid, sturdy metal. Feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic toy like other digital cameras.* Has features galore!!! Has standard features plus some pretty nice extras such as:-customizable flash-can change the strength of the flash, helping to prevent washed out pictures which is common with most digital cameras when you use the flash.-flips landscapes pictures that would normally appear sideways. the camera lets you flip these pictures rightside up so you won't have to do it on your computer.-can take panoramic pictures.-the camera is customizable! What does this mean? This camera lets you customize the startup screen. You have an option between clear blue water, evening skyline or a sitting bird. You can change the startup sound, your options include a default theme, science fiction and animal sounds(dog barking or bird chirping). These sounds are designed to presumably match the startup screens but they can be mix and matched. The shutter also has various sounds you can choose from. All these sounds can, of course, be turned off.-this list goes on and on. Check this camera out to see everything.* Superb true true-to-life daytime and night pictures.* Pictures come out crisp and sharp with or without the flash, inbrightly lit or darky lit areas.* What you see is what you get. What you see on the LCD screen is usually how the pictures will appear on your computer monitor or when you print them out. The LCD, when you press lightly on theshutter button, will show you actually how the picture will appear once viewed on screen or on paper. So if your LCD has a bright contrast and you are in a dark room, when you press the shutter button lightly, the LCD will adjust itself to the actual lighting of the room. There will be no deception and you won't have to wonder why the pictures look lighter on the LCD than on the computer screen or in print.* Can record mini movies with sound.* Uses compact flash card.There is much, much more that I can add on to this list but you will have get this camera and see for yourself.Negatives:* Hard to install the driver software on th PC. I had to ask Canon tech support for help. Even then the process was very confusing.* Joystick navigator takes some getting used to. Very hard to maneuver through the menus resulting in accidently going to the wrong options.* There is no power button. You have to shut the lens' lid to turn off the camera. This makes me nervous. I'm always scared that this will somehow damage the lens.* The macro setting isn't the best. Sometimes the macro pictures can appear blurry.* Uses the very expensive NB-2L rechargable battery as opposed to inexpensive, more common rechargables such as NiMHs or other types. Plus NB-2Ls can only be used with PowerShot S30, S40 cameras and Elura 40mc camcorders.I was initially put off by the price of this camera but I must say it is well worth the money.Get the Canon PowerShot S30 if you want superior quality in a small package."",)"
"('Too bad AR has somehow found it necessary to discontinue this product line -- but luckily it means you get a decent audio interconnect at great prices. According to the Amazon product page, most people are buying other cables instead, for no reason that I can ascertain other than this AR blue-jacket line looking a little plain next to others. I don\'t buy a/v cables for their appearance, especially since the packaging of most cables is all the product really offers. Monster Cables\' line is overglorified trash with awful sound, harsh and muddled, with overly ripe and tubby disco bass. Belden\'s audio cables seem mushy and strident, sounding hardly cleaner than common hookup wire. I\'ve been using this older AR line for several years. The sound is fairly neutral (which is the way a cable is supposed to work, folks). When harsh treble is present, as it usually is(!), at least these AR\'s make it a little more tolerable. If the source bass is clean and solid, it\'ll sound that way thru this cable. Midrange is clear, with good soundstage depth and width, and you can pretty well hear distinct instruments in big bands and orchestras, with a good ""pop"" on drums -- little or none of which can be said for many of AR\'s competitors. I had to string two 20-foot lengths together to get enough audio line to reach a second TV, and had no trouble with this product. I also have some shorter over-$200 wires that do sound a bit better on my stereo, but who can afford several connections at that price? Anyway, most home home DVD players and TV\'s don\'t generate audio as well as a $7500 sound system, so for most a/v setups I\'d say the old Performance Series has some terrific bargains and above-average performance. AR/Recoton is to be faulted for not keeping this line alive; junk like Monster might have shoved it off store shelves, but audiophiles and videophiles I know are stocking up on these tried-and-true blue-jacket cables. Take advantage of the good prices while you can.',)"

"('I also found them pretty easy to install. The sound is good, but not fantastic. Although I am still trying to decide how much to blame the speakers and how much to blame the echoey (sp) nature of the room.My only real complaint is the narrow cone of audible area. I have 2 speakers mounted in my kitchen with a 255 cm ceiling. You have to be pretty close to directly under the speakers to hear them well. I have 4 mounted in my living room at 310cm height. They deliver a larger listening area, but still limited. For a three cushion couch in a home theatre setup this would probably be acceptable. But as background music in a living room, I would have had to buy more speakers to cover the area uniformly.Pros- easy install once you cut the hole (which is not hard with a cheap drywall handsaw)- great finished look- reasonable priceCons- narrow sound area',)"

"('The Sony KV-32FS13 WEGA TV is expensive compared to conventional (non-flat-screen) TVs. So you have a difficult choice: which one to buy - a conventional TV from Sharp, JVC, Toshiba or Panasonic (which will still provide good picture quality) or Sony\'s WEGA flatscreen, which looks cool, but costs substantially more.For example, you can buy two Panasonic 32G5 for the same price that 32FS13 costs. When I went to Circuit City yesterday, 32G5 cost [amt] and 32FS13 cost [amt].Let\'s see why Sony 32FS13 costs more.Flat ScreenTVs with flat screen cost substantially more than ""conventional"" sets. The fact that the screen is flat bears not only esthetic value, but improves your viewing experience. The main advantage of the flat screen is the fact that the straight lines look straight on the flat screen when watched from an angle (in conventional TVs they get curved) and there is no picture distortion neither when watched from an angle nor in the corners when watched directly.Another advantage of the flat screen is the fact that the glare is significantly reduced, since the flat screen reflects the light at a consistent angle, so the light coming from above gets reflected down and where you cannot see glare. Conventional TV CRTs reflect light in all directions, creating glare.It\'s Not HDTVWhy waste money? The 32FS13 is a ""regular"" TV, but it has all inputs you need to enjoy current widespread digital and analog video sources, including S-Video and component video input for digital sources like DVD, digital satellite receivers, digital camcorders and VCRs. The HDTV is not widespread and is not going to be for quite a while.InputsIn addition to composite and RF inputs, this TV has S-Video and component video inputs on the rear panel. The presence of S-Video and component video inputs is one of the features not found on the cheapest TVs, even 36"", including 36"" Sharp TV I saw at Best Buy yesterday for [amt].The comb filter is used to separate chrominance and luminance from the composite video signal, so if you use S-Video or component jacks, you will avoid rainbow-like Moire patterns while watching your movies.Since this model comes with both S-Video and component inputs, you can use them to get better detail level and edge definition from your DVD player or other high-resolution sources. S-Video input allows you to bypass the comb filter and pass the signal directly to color decoder, and component input allows you to bypass both.FeaturesThe set of features that 32FS13 implements is impressive. You can see them on Sony\'s web site. If you are price-conscious, you will find that these features are not extensive enough to translate to such an elevated price comparing to competition. The extras you pay is for the flat screen, good looks, Sony\'s name and picture quality, which is really good.Picture QualityYes, Sony does not sell their products cheap. Neither they are leaders in quality control (as you can see from the ""Consumer Reports Reliability Survey"", where they lag behind JVC, Panasonic and some others). But they implement new interesting technologies and their TVs are at the top in terms of picture quality.This model produces excellent picture quality. I have seen better picture quality, but the TVs that I saw it at cost much more than this one. The picture is sharp and clear, even in the corners of the screen, where TVs usually have difficulties focusing (helped in part by Sony\'s Magnetic Quadra Pole dynamic focus system).The TV also employs a three-line digital comb filter to improve the separation of chrominance and luminance (color and light information). Although the TV does not employ the more advanced 3D filter (which helps better for static images), the edges are well-defined, besides the use of an S-Video or component video input with high-quality sources allows for even better edge definition.Keep in mind though, that flat screen aside, the picture quality produced by this TV when fed by an RF signal or analog cable is not substantially better than, say Panasonic 32G5, which costs twice less. Where the difference is more noticeable is when you feed DVD or digital satellite signal.Remote ControlThe TV comes with a universal remote control that allows you to control the TV, VCR, DVD player, cable box or satellite receiver. Some buttons are small, but the remote is compact and the button layout is quite logical.ConclusionIt might be a difficult choice: price vs. features, looks and performance. The 32FS13 looks cool, features excellent picture and set of features and has all necessary inputs. But you can another 32"" TV for twice less with not much loss in useful features and performance.If [amt] premium is a non-issue, get FS13. Otherwise, get Panasonic 32G5, and invest the [amt] you saved in technology stocks. I doubt they can go any lower.',)"

"(""I have this unit (purchased on eBay a couple of years ago) as well as the original Nuvomedia Rocket eBook. I purchased this device only because I was concerned that one day my original Rocket would stop recharging. That's the reason for 4 stars: proprietary, non-replaceable battery. However, battery life is excellent. With backlighting set at 20%, I get 8-12 hours of reading on a charge. That's enough for a flight from Chicago to Tokyo. So far, both my devices are still holding a charge just fine.The backlight is the biggest drain on the battery. At 100%, you can use the reader to light your way down a dark hall. Imagine what that does to your eyes when reading! I find that 20% is sufficient to make up for most odd lighting conditions where you can't read the screen without backlighting. Too bad E-Ink technology wasn't around when they were still making this device.As a boon to those of us with aging eyes, you can download any TrueType font currently installed on your PC (unfortunately for us Mac folks, this device's software is PC-only; this device is the main reason I keep a PC in the house), at any size. You can choose two different typefaces to keep in the reader, and each can be a different size.The buttons to advance from page to page are large and well-placed. You can decide which one is 'forward' and which is 'backward.' (I prefer the bottom button to advance pages.) You can also decide which orientation works best for you: buttons on the left or the right with the screen vertical, or buttons at the top or bottom with the screen horizontal. This is handy because the reader can get a little heavy if you're holding it one-handed. If I read while eating, I like to orient the screen with the buttons at the top; the battery 'bump' serves as a stand, holding the reader at an angle I can see without craning my head.If you keep the supplied dictionary loaded, you can look up words in a story as you read it. You can add 'margin notes' if you like, although they don't appear alongside the text. The note is attached to a highlighted section of text, and touching the highlight opens a window with the note in it. There's a bookmarking facility, as well. This isn't necessary if you keep the story loaded in the reader until you finish it; every time you come back, the reader is on the page you last read. However, bookmarking is useful if you want to unload the story before finishing. Just connect the reader to your PC, launch the librarian software, and let it update itself with the data in the book. The bookmarks and notes will transfer to the librarian, and then back to the reader when you reload the story.The unit's built-in 8mb of memory is sufficient for dozens of short stories as well as several full-length novels. I have a 128mb SmartMedia card installed so that I can carry a lot more novels while traveling.There is a certain paucity of material available for download nowadays, unfortunately. Baen Books supports the REB format for science fiction, and Fictionwise sells short stories, novellas and full-length books of various types. However, the major publishers -- and thus the major booksellers -- dropped the format when Gemstar (which bought the device from Nuvomedia) scrapped the readers because it was no longer possible to make REB format files that were encrypted to a specific reader. (You know how most publishers love their DRM. After all, we're just slavering pirates waiting for the opportunity to bootleg their books. Makes you wonder why publishing houses aren't organizing protests in front of libraries and photocopier manufacturing plants.)Fortunately, the original RocketLibrarian software and the later eBook Librarian software will convert text into the unencrypted version REB format. You use a subset of HTML commands for formatting, and can run just straight through from start to end or break it up into chapters, with links at the end of each to the table of contents or the next/previous chapter. It just depends on how detailed you want to get with the HTML code.And because HTML is the lingua franca for creating your own REB files, you can pull down Web pages and convert them, too. However, this works best with pages that stick with simple HTML and don't have dozens of advertising links. The librarian software ignores any code it doesn't understand, but it will follow links to other pages if you tell it to, which can lead to huge files, and not necessarily organized in any fashion that makes sense. Where copyright law stands on this, I can't say. Suffice to say that doing this to a Web page so you can read it at your leisure and then delete it is probably okay. Passing the file around to other people, whether or not you charge anything, is probably not okay.Connection to your computer is via USB cable. It's a nonstandard connection at the reader end. There's also a built-in modem, which was once used to connect directly to Gemstar's bookstore; as far as I know, it's of no use now.As of today (11 April 2006), you can still download the librarian software, which will let you create unencrypted REB files, at this site: [...] However, Gemstar has stated that they will completely close all ebook operations as of 16 July 2006 ([...] Quite likely, this page will then disappear.All in all, this is an excellent ebook reader. It's easy to use, has good battery life, and with the appropriate librarian software, will let you add your own content to your library. Reading material is available for sale, if not necessarily the bestsellers. You might prefer a regular hardback to sit around the house -- I still buy them; just ask Amazon! -- but for travel, this device is ideal. Highly recommended, while it's still available."",)"
"('I\'m a newcomer to the vinyl scene. With pretty much no knowledge about turntables I was looking for one that was pretty much idiot proof.This bad boy fit the bill. Out of the box all you have to do really is attach the drive belt and attach the platter, and depending if you have a phono input on you\'re receiver, you have to click the built in preamp switch on or off. No calibration of speeds was necessary. Whole process from unpacking to playing LP took 5 minutes at most. My bedroom system consists of the following:Sony STR-6045 Receiver (1974)Sony PSLX350H TurntableKlipsch SB-1 Bookshelf\'sMonster Cable & Acoustic Research InterconnectsMy receiver has a phono input, so I didn\'t have to use the built in preamp. The first 2 LP\'s I tested was a copy of Death Cab For Cutie ""Transatlantiscm"" and John Coltrane ""A Love Supreme"". I hit the ""Start"" button on the front of the turntable and the arm automatically went up, then down on the edge of the record...how easy was that?Right of the bat I noticed that sound was spectacular. The highs were crisp and the bass was low and distortion free. It could be my particular setup, but I was really impressed. My receiver was built in 1974, so I can only imagine how it would sound through a modern day receiver. I have absolutely no complaints as far as sound quality.I next hooked up the turntable to my PC to rip some 7"" singles that I had acquired. I ran the turntable with the built in preamp on to my SoundBlaster Live! Card with a Monster Cable RCA to mini cable. I ripped the tracks using MusicMatch and encoded at 128kbps. The whole process went off without a hitch. The mp3s sounded great and the process couldn\'t have been easier.Now onto my complaints:1.The overall feel of this turntable is kind of cheap. It seems pretty much all plastic. But then again, at this price what do you expect?2.The feet are not adjustable.3.I have heard that replacing the stylus is a total pain. I have not yet had to do so, but it seems according to others that it is only available through Sony for $50. I do suspect that by going to [...] you will be able to find a suitable replacement though, and for considerably less.To wrap it up, this is a great turntable for a beginner. Spectacular if you take the price into consideration. Right out of the box it was easy to set up and use. While the build quality is questionable, at the price you can\'t really complain. I do plan to upgrade to a higher quality manual turntable once I read up on how to properly calibrate and care for it.This link is to NeedleDoctor.com.

"(""The best mouse on the market. I've purchased 5 over the years. Much less strain on wrist and arms using The Marble."",)"
"('Stick and move, stick and move, stick and move; this action describes not the butterfly like movements of a great boxer, but the movement of my aging ball mouse across my computer screen.  I undertook all of the regular remedies for this type of bad behavior; I removed the ball and cleaned it with alcohol, I removed the dirt and dust from all surfaces, I prayed the to mouse gods for smooth and silky cursor operations, all to no avail.So I went searching for a new mouse, an optical mouse, one I had heard about in one of trade magazine I read; the one without the ball!  The ""Microsoft IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" is the latest in a long distinguished and creative list of hardware gadgets to come out of Redmond, WA over the years.  The old fashioned ball, which has been the mainstay of the mouse since it introduction way back when, in the early 70\'s, is gone, replaced by an optical sensor, Microsoft has dubbed the IntelliEye.  The IntelliEye has no moving parts, but instead uses an optical (red) sensor that tracks the movement of the mouse up to 1,500 times per second. And since the IntelliEye is sealed, dirt and dust, which has been the death knell for many a conventional mouse, is no longer a problem.Shaped like the conventional IntelliMouse, the ""IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" offers the same neat fit to the hand and the same innovative track wheel for easy scrolling of web pages and web-enabled documents.  And you can throw away those often in the way mouse pads because the ""IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" will work on hundreds of work surfaces, including clothing, and will also work if lifted two or three inches above a flat surface.  However, the ""IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" will not work on a reflective surface such as glass or other surfaces with a glossy finish.  The mouse may also have difficulty tracking on magazine covers, photographs, or newspapers.Installation of the mouse was a snap and can utilize either the traditional round 9-pin DIN connection, or a USB port; I chose the 9 pin DIN connector.  Windows 98 Me, recognized the mouse automatically and the software installation via CD-ROM was seamless.I have been using the ""IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" for a little over a month now and I couldn\'t be happier with its performance and operation.  The mouse cursor glides smoothly and effortlessly across the screen, and I am as happy as a man with a bowl filled high with Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream with mini chocolate chip cookies, crumpled on top, watching a Bruce Lee movie; in other words I am a happy Bard.And while the cost is a little steep at $55.00 retail (I brought it on sale for $39.00), I believe it is work every penny.  If you are as tired as I was of the stick and move technique of mouse pointing, you\'ll fall in love with the ""IntelliMouse With IntelliEye"" from Microsoft.

"(""Yes, the color was the first consideration. My three-year-old JVC 20&quot; TV is black, my 6-month-old JVC slim DVD player is black, and so I wanted a black VCR to go with them.My nine-year-old Panasonic PV-4308 died (well, OK, I killed it trying to force-feed a video) right after Christmas. For the longest time, I enjoyed not having a VCR at all. I have yet to find one that doesn't take up any room or is as slim as my trusty JVC XV-N50BK DVD player. All VCRs are fat!However, I'm not prepared to spend an exorbitant amount on a PVR or DVD recorder yet, even though I can afford it. I think it's dumb to spend that kind of money on a gadget when there are people who can't eat, or are having their civil liberties taken away, etc. Besides, I'm still getting VHS tapes as presents, and I have a fair amount of tapes that I still enjoy. So, I finally decided to buy another one.Why didn't I buy a JVC unit, since it would be compatible with the equipment I have? They do have a black one, a model readily available at the discount electronic retailers, but it doesn't review very well. I'm puzzled that JVC would drop the ball on their video equipment when everything they make is top drawer, but I decided not to chance it. I stuck with a name I knew.Why not get a stereo unit for not much more? Panasonic's PV-V4523 VCR is readily available at the discount electronic retailer, but nobody likes it. The one everyone likes is the PV-V4623, but I ruled it out on three counts. One, it wasn't locally available, only online; two, I decided against stereo VCRs in general because it would be too much hassle to unplug my DVD player's audio output to run the VCR's stereo. A mono VCR hooks up through the antenna and plays the sound through the TV tuner. I don't have to go to the back of my set and pull plugs out every time I want to watch a different format. But I guess the most important reason I didn't get either is number three: neither one of them comes in black.I even considered one of those space-saving combo units that's half DVD and half VCR. That was ruled out, too, because then I'd have two DVD players and one VCR. I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't find any that were as low profile as my DVD player, which is also why I don't like the TiVos and other DVRs. And then there's that color problem: no black.So, I went and got the V4022 on Saturday in time for the Grammys and CBS Sunday Morning. It's sure a different animal from my former Panasonic VCR. The new remote is quite a bit smaller. It would be nice if I could get my DVD player's remote to work on the VCR, but alas, no record button!The rewind is downright frightening! I'm not sure what it's doing yet; it would speed up and then slow down, stop, then start again until it was through. Hey, I remember a time when VCRs didn't rewind at all; luckily all three of mine have had this feature. The record is slow on the uptake. There's some lag time if you use the one-touch, it's not quite as immediate as I'm used to.I listen to my TV through stereo headphones, so I really don't pay attention to the noise level. Outside of the whirring sound it makes when rewinding, I'm not sure how to grade on that. Recording is still possible in three speeds: sp, lp and slp. As usual the best quality is the fastest speed. Neither speed gives DVD quality.The manual is more like a folding road map rather than an actual book. I haven't fully studied it yet, other than to read how to hook it up and how to reset the channels. You'll need to know this. If you don't have cable, make sure to tell the VCR this after the auto channel setup. The factory set it up to look for cable channels, and you end up with way more channels than you need.This is only the third VCR I've had in eighteen years. One was an Emerson that lasted nine years. Next was the Panasonic PV-4308 that lasted nine years also. I really don't expect that kind of longevity out of this one, due to the fact that I will have gone digital and high definition before the next nine years is up. But until then, until I have to change to a silver HDTV, I expect this Panasonic V4022 will last as long as I need it to."",)"

"('If you are truly interested in a quality portable DVD player, I would shy away from this one. However, that was not my intensions when I purchased this item. I wanted a relatively inexpensive (less than $ 30.00) DVD player that I could hook up to any TV and watch pre-recorded and recorded DVD movies when I was out of town and on the road. You can accomplish that with this player (via a RF modulator and some A/V cable and coax cable). I did not want to spend $150.00 - $300.00 on a portable DVD player.The good: This unit is very portable, small, compact and lightweight. It is not very expensive and it has a fairly well know brand name attached to it (Koss). It has played every DVD and CD I used in it, including the ones I recorded myself utilizing my computer or my stand alone home Panasonic DVD recorder. It delivers a pretty good picture quality and the sound quality is not bad either. Of course, all this depends on the quality of the television set you have in home, or in my case, your hotel room (UGH).Now for the bad: After about 45 minutes to an hour of continuous playing time, the picture and sound starts to ""freeze"". Afterwhich, the unit discontinues to play any further. This is an inherient problem with all these units. Just read all the other reviews below. The unit get too hot to properly load and play any DVD or CD. Period. So you are warned. It does not run on batteries, only A/C. You have to hook up a lot of wires to make it go (power cord, RF Modulator, coax cable, A/V wires, etc...) It does not have it\'s own screen and/or it\'s own internal speakers (but then again, what do you expect for the price).I knew about the overheating problem beforehand by just reading the reviews of others prior to purchasing it. But, for $ 30.00 I figured how can you go wrong. My solution to this problem was to purchase a small 4"" fan ($3.97 at WalMart), place the DVD player on a small cup to allow the air to circulate around the top and bottom of the unit, and direct the air towards the back of the unit. Do not place the DVD player directly on a tabletop and definetly not on any soft item. Too much heat is generated in the unit and the player cannot dissipate the heat quickly enough function properly.I also purchased the extended warranty for this unit, since it only comes with a 90 day warranty period. For $ 5.99 you can get a full replacement warranty for up to a year. Well worth it because this unit has a high probiblity of failing completely within a year, if you plan on using it a lot.All in all, 3 stars is a fair rating for this product. It works to accomplish all my objective (although I have to help it along a bit). And as I said earlier, you can\'t beat the price.',)"
"(""This thing rocks! I searched around and re-looked at so many different mp3 players before finally settling on this one. First of all, this one had the best reviews and also had all the features I wanted. Here are some highlights of it:1) Good battery life. I get at least 8 hours out of it and I still have battery left. I haven't had to use it longer than 8h ours so I don't know how much longer it lasts. I'm sure if you do a lot of recording it'll drain quicker. I think most of the people that complain about battery life are heavily using it for recording. Also, I think if you keep the backlight on a lot or you use shuffle a lot that can also decrease the battery life faster. I keep my backlight on the lowest setting and I only use shuffle occasionally.2) Lots of space and FAST! We're talking 20GB here! I fit my entire mp3 library of 15GB on this thing so I can listen to all of my music at work or in the car. It's awesome! Also, the USB2.0 is so fast. I transferred my entire 15GB library in only 30 minutes! This thing can also be used as a normal hard drive. So I have another 5GB I can use to transfer stuff around.3) No special software. You don't have to install the MusicMatch software that comes with this thing. It's a piece of junk anyway, and that's MusicMatch's fault, not Archos. The iPod also uses MusicMatch and it has the same complaint, except you're REQUIRED to use their special software! The Archos just hooks up, appears as a drive called JUKEBOX in your explorer, and you just drag-and-drop. I didn't install anything when I got mine; I just plugged it in.4) Sounds great. This thing sounds just as good as my portable CD player. I haven't used the headphones that come with it because I never use bundled headphones, but if you have a favorite pair of headphones, I think you'll be pleased with the sound. Plus, the sound is very configurable to your tastes.5) Firmware is EASY. The people that complain about the software and manual must be morons. I haven't picked up the manual once and I know how all the features work. It's just so intuitive. A couple tips:o) Hold down the 'play' button for a couple seconds on a directory or on a song to add it to the playlist.o) Yes, you CAN edit playlists from within the archos. There's a menu for it right in the main menu.o) Use the up/down keys to increase/decrease the volume during playback.o) Charge the Archos for a few hours before transferring files over. Otherwise, it won't go as fast and your connection might be terminated because there's not enough power. When I first got this thing, I made the mistake and I almost thought this thing was flaky. I left for a couple hours, came back, and it's worked flawlessly ever since.There's another firmware called Rockbox (you can search for it on Google) that's supposedly better. I used it for a bit, but I actually found the Archos firmware to be more intuitive so I haven't messed around with Rockbox much. I'll prolly get around to it. Upgrading the firmware is really easy too. You just drag a file onto the hard-drive. If you accidently delete the archos firmware, you can just download it from their website.Don't listen to others about their Tech Support reviews. Sure, I wish it were an 800 number, but I've talked to them and they were fine. I had to RMA my very first one due to a malfunctional touch pad, but I got my new one right away and I've been so happy ever since. Someone likes to use these shady statistics of &quot;Oh, well 11 of 84 had problems so that must mean 130,000 out of 1,000,000 units fail!&quot; You just can't compare things in that way. It doesn't take into consideration people that never reviewed, bought ones from other sites, complained but then had their units replaced and are happy, etc.Save yourself hassle and money. The iPod is way overpriced and delicate. This thing is not bulky (even though some people say it's heavy), and it's not going to scratch from you breathing on it. People that say this obviously haven't used an iPod. iPods are fragile and once you scratch it the first time, you'll start crying because you spent A LOT of money on it.Overall, this is the right unit for the right price. And, if you don't like some features, there's an active project to make new and enhanced features. Lots of people use this thing and are happy. I'm one of them."",)"
"('We\'ve had this camera for a couple weeks now, and really enjoy it. We also purchased a 128M SmartMedia card, which is almost a requirement for this camera, since 16M will run out really quick if you\'re taking high-resolution pictures!Picture quality is great, although red-eye is a bigger problem than it was with my previous, 35mm camera (though I haven\'t tried the red-eye reduction flash mode yet). The software that comes with the camera has a red-eye filter, but it doesn\'t look very good (imaging taking a black crayon to your picture, and you\'re not far off).I haven\'t noticed the focusing problems that some people have reported. The time between when you click the button and when the picture is taken isn\'t long, IF you first press it slightly to set the focus -- if you set the focus first, the actual picture is taken almost immediately. If not, there\'s about a two second delay before the picture is taken. This isn\'t that different than some 35mm cameras I\'ve seen without a fixed focus -- it takes the camera a second to adjust the focus to where it should be before it snaps the picture.It does take several seconds to reset between pictures (much of that time appears to be the time it takes to write to the card -- switching to a lower-resolution format may change how long you have to wait between pictures). Fresh batteries seem to help minimize this delay -- get four high-capacity (1800 mAh) NiMH rechargable batteries, and charge two while two are in the camera. Swap the pairs before you start getting any low battery indicators, to keep the pair in the camera fresh.You really need to read the manual with this one -- the controls aren\'t difficult, but some of them aren\'t intuitive (if you want to review the picture you just took while the lens cover is open, you have to ""double-click"" on the view button). It\'s easy to hand it to someone to just point-and-shoot a picture -- it\'s the more advanced features that aren\'t intuitive. Once you learn a couple shortcuts, it\'s not hard to use at all, but you won\'t be able to just pick this up and use the advanced features without reading the manual first. Many of the complaints I\'ve seen in other Amazon.com reviews about things this camera can\'t do, it really CAN do -- you just need to know how.I really love the fact that once you set the time on the camera, all your pictures are stamped with the date/time that you took your picture (and even what the camera settings were at the time). This makes it a lot easier to sort through pictures later, or to remember how old someone is in the shot. This may be a standard feature of digital camera, but it\'s a nice one.Using this with Windows XP Professional was a snap -- just plug in the USB cable, let Windows recognize it, and copy the files to your hard drive. We had it a week before we installed the software that came with the camera, and even then we only use what\'s built into Windows. There\'s even a way to print sheets of pictures (a bunch of wallets, or several 3x5s, or a contact sheet with dozens of thumbnails) built right into the OS (the ""Windows Picture and Fax Viewer"").Overall, we\'ve been very happy with this camera. Good quality, inexpensive (less than most 2MP cameras that don\'t have optical zoom!), easy to use.',)"

"(""PROS:1-truly ergonmic. maximum comfort.2-keys that never wear out (no fading)3-reliable. the keys keep working reliably for me & they don't lose their 'spring' or start mistyping. when a keyboard starts to fail, it can insert extra letters or other random keys--I haven't experienced that with this keyboard.4-speed. I can type a bit faster on this keyboard, and I make less errors. The keys are positioned better so that it's somewhat easier for me to type. I probably type 20 words per minute less on other keyboards.5-compatibility. its made by Microsoft, and is instantly recognized by my OS without issues (and with full functionality). i've used this with openSUSE, Red Hat and other linux distros without issue as well. For any PC/ Linux machine this shouldn't have problems.CONS:1-non standard delete/insert/page up/down positions (I got used to it though)2-one of the little round non-scratch rubber pieces is coming off (this is after taking a serious beating though). Its hard to say if this is actually a con since I've had the rubber non-scratch pads fall off faster on other brands of keyboards.OTHER:1-no multi-media keys: This is smaller than some of the really big premium keyboards so there's no space for  no multi-media keys. For me that was a pro though (not a con). I usually end up disabling the multi-media keys anyway, since opening my email or a web-page randomly when I'm trying to type are an annoyance. I can still configure hot-keys to do the same thing anyway (I think the extra buttons are unnecessary).2-it has a cord: For me this is a pro, since I don't like replacing batteries. if you prefer cordless keyboards, then this might not be for you.MORE DETAILS:In my opinion, after trying many keyboards over the last 15 years this is THE best ergonomic split keyboard out there. I'm a software developer and I can go 10-15 hours straight on this keyboard day after day, year after year without issues. When I try to use a standard keyboard things feel very awkward and my hands and wrists eventually start to cramp after a few days. In fact, if I go a few weeks on a standard keyboard, I start to develop symptoms of carpal tunnel. After I go back to this ergonomic keyboard, the problems disappear.The home/insert/delete keys are not in the standard positions, which can throw you off if you're using linux/putty (on a standard keyboard with the normal configuration) and you're trying to do things like shift-insert paste, etc. I got accustomed to the key potions after using this keyboard for a while, and I actually prefer it this way now.This keyboard will ruin other keyboards for you. After using this for a few months I tried to go back to a normal keyboard and I felt the awkward discomfort of a standard cramped key configuration. Once you go ergonomic you probably wont want to go back (to standard keyboard)."",)"
"('The Cannon PowerShot S330 is my first digital camera. I had it for about six weeks so far and I just love it. As a result of getting this camera, in the past six weeks I\'ve taken more pictures at family events then probably the last 6 years combined using conventional cameras. To me, the best thing about digital photography is the instant feedback. You can see your picture as soon as you take it. And if you don\'t mind wasting some battery, you can use the LCD screen to frame your shots so every picture comes out exactly the way you like it. And downloading the pictures also makes things easy.Basic FeaturesThe camera is capable of 2.0-mega pixel resolutions and it has a 3x optical zoom lens and 2.5 digital zoom. The camera is small, I would say a little bigger then a cigarette box and fits in your hands or pickets easily. Both the front and the back of the camera are finished in metal so it weights a little more then other cameras but not to the point where it is heavy to carry. The S330 also comes with a very bright 2.5"" LCD screen in the back. Even in direct sunlight you should still have no problem seeing the screen. With the LCD screen on all the time, I estimate that you should be able to get about 100 to 150 pictures depending how much flash you use. The S330 doesn\'t come with an AC adapter kit so when you need to recharge, you have to take out the battery and put it in the special battery charger that plugs directly to the wall jack. I thought this was kind of awkward but has since gotten use to it.Advance FeaturesThe PowerShot S330 is very easy to use as a point-and-shoot camera but it also has a number of advance features like shutter speed and ISO settings if you need it. It also has a number of white balance controls which helps compensate the different lighting conditions such as fluorescent, cloudy and etc. I\'ve tried to use this features a couple of times but haven\'t quite master it. I would imagine that most people would never need this feature but if you are a tweaker, there should be enough options in this camera to keep you satisfied.Besides the regular camera like features, it also has a movie mode and stitch assist mode that are interesting. The stitch assist mode is for panoramic shots and it\'s best to do this with a tripod so at the points where the pictures are stitched together, the object wouldn\'t look warped. The camera does not stitch the pictures, that process is done separately when you connect the camera to the computer. The stitched pictures will have a stitch line linking them together indicating that these pictures were shot in stitch mode. Clicking on the stitch line would launch the software program to for the panoramic picture. And you can stitch as many pictures together as you want.The movie mode is something I\'ve only used a couple of time. The camera stores short film clips and it limits how long you can shoot depending on the resolution of the film. The clips are limited from 10 to 30 seconds and in 640x480 resolution (which is the largest), it would only record for 10 seconds and not 30.PicturesIn terms of the quality of the picture, I am pretty satisfied with it. Sometimes the picture is a little soft around the edges or kind of fuzzy but that\'s not every single time. The color of the photo is decent but IMHO, not 100% true to life. There are quit a few pictures I\'ve taken the found it to be too red or yellow. But most outdoor shots in daylight that looks just wonderful. The flashlight packs a big punch for something so small. Anything within 8 feet is no problem at all in dark situations. The focus light has a slightly shorter effective distance so sometimes the camera can\'t focus so when you push the shutter and nothing happens. This is kind of frustrating but just try to take a few steps closer to your subject and it should be fine.Just about every picture I take with this camera, I take it in 1600x1400 resolution and in fine mode. This way, any pictures that I like I can have it developed and look just like it was taken from a conventional camera. In this largest format, the photo is about 1MB each. So with a 128MB compact flash card, you can still store plenty of pictures. Unfortunately, Canon only provides a 8MB CF card with the camera so make sure you buy a CF card if you don\'t already have it. Also, because of S330\'s small size, it is only capable of accepting Type I CF cards and not Type II. So like IBM\'s 1 GB MicroDrive is not compatible with this camera.IssuesMaybe I\'ve missed this in the user\'s manual but I have yet to find a battery meter that shows me how much juice is left in the battery. When the power is running low, the camera would just shut down with very little warning. I guess Canon just didn\'t think this is a critical issue since the pictures are all already saved in the memory so advance warnings on the battery running low is pretty useless. But just be prepared and the best solution is to have a second battery so you can just switch it when one runs out.For such a well build camera it\'s very disappointing to see the cheesy flap it uses to cover the USB and video ports on the side of the camera. Not a major issue though.Canon did not include any bag or pouch for the storage of this camera. Even though the camera is small enough to fit just about anywhere, the metal finishing is brushed and can be easily scratched. A soft pouch would be perfect to protect the surface but not included so protect your investment and get one on your own.I am not going to complain about the 2-mega-pixel limit because it\'s more then enough for an average user. A well taken 2-mega-pix pictures developed on 4x6 film would look no different than if it\'s taken on a 35mm camera. So don\'t buy more then you need because the higher the resolution, the more memory it needs and more time it takes to save a picture. So take a closer look at the Canon PowerShot S330 because it might be just what you\'re looking for....',)"
"('After a long search, I decided on the PowerShot S330 based on extensive reviews on the quality of the image. It is an excellent 2MP camera! Minolta had an ultraslim 2MP, but avid digital camera viewers have said that the shape does not compensate for the poor image quality. As I have come across other 2MP contendors, the ELPH shape is by far the best. Shortly after I bought the camera, Konica came out with a slightly smaller 3.34MP (Konica KD-300Z) for about the same price. However there are few reviews and little product information available... The s330 has the cool Elph shape, is slightly thicker than its predecessors, but has a solid feel to it.A few items of note to guide the (first-time) shopper based on 2 months of use:1. BATTERY. Battery life is very good. I also bought a generic NB-1LH as a back up from SterlingTek; it is purportedly 800mAH, versus the Canon brand 840mAH and previous Canon NB-1L (680mAH)that first came with the s330.2. MEDIA. Bought a 256MB TypeI CF card, and can now get ~256 photos at the highest resolution (vs. the 8MB that comes with the camera). I rarely take that many pictures at a time before a download, so there is also much room for video clips. Being the TypeA that I am, I also bought an extra 128MB at a good price that may come in handy when traveling for tourist-type photos.3. MOVIES. The movie clip quality is as others have remarked, only satisfactory even at the highest resolution setting. (I almost do not notice a difference between settings). However, the clips do include SOUND and provide a TON of ENTERTAINMENT! The files are already at about 3MB size. It would be difficult to share larger files. (For better quality, one should consider a video camera.) The clips are best viewed at about the size of the 1.5"" LCD screen. *DO* remember to record in landscape format (!) as you cannot rotate the clip for viewing.4. DOWNLOADING. The software and USB cable method appear to work well. Although downloading directly from the camera will consume batter power, I don\'t feel compelled to by a CF reader or an AC adapter since I have the extra battery. Others have remarked on the flimsy rubber cover over the A/V out and digital out and speculate that it may not last the life of the camera.5. IMAGES. The images are excellent. If they turn out substandard, you may be able to clean them up w/the accompanying software. If you\'re good with the manual settings, you can probably get the quality you are looking for. Definitely comparable to my old 35mm; and I don\'t see a huge difference from a friend\'s 3MP (Canon Powershot S30).6. LIGHTING/OTHER. The camera has excellent compensation for different lighting (natural, cloudy, flourescent, tungsten, etc.) Alternatively, you can adjust this manually.  The Elph line appears to have problems with red-eye reduction.  Others have remarked that the red-eye reduction setting is less than satisfactory.  Thank goodness for software editing (on CD that comes with camera).7. ZOOM. I think a 3x optical zoom is a MUST for a 2MP camera. Turned off the digital zoom, as I don\'t want false hope of having quality zoom at the purported ~7.5x total zoom. The zoom is actually slightly better than my old 35mm.8. OTHER MANUAL FEATURES. I\'ve always been a point-and-shoot user, however, there appear to be many manual features that offer a lot of flexibility. I suggest practicing with these features, e.g. exposure, white balance, shutter speed, iso.9. CASE. Doesn\'t come with camera. I bought the Canon PSC-300 case which has a small hole for the wrist stap to pass though and may be worn on your belt. I tried the PSC-20 case.  It was just too large for me, I could also stick the USB connector in the bottom.  I picked up a cheap case (under ten dollars) by Lowerpro which fits like a glove!  It has a zipper pouch without the annoying velcro flap-over of the PSC-300 and PSC20 that would stick to my wrist strap.I have to admit a bit of ""pixel envy"", but the 2MP and seems adequate for most of my cropping/enlargement needs, and printing 4x6s to 5x7s, possibly 8x10s. 3MP will likely provide more cropping/enlargement options considering the current optical zoom limits. My criteria were size and image quality for approximately three- to four-hundred US$. When canon comes out with a 3MP I will consider upgrading when the price comes down to current s330 prices.  (Since my original writing Canon came out with the s230--I\'m not totally sure which I would buy at this point.)If you\'re looking for a compact 2MP camera, the s330 is the ONE for you!Update... i just bought the s400.  Love the new processor, smaller size, and 4MP.',)"

"('Samsung 191T 19"" LCD Monitor ReviewFriday, November 22, 2002I love my new 191T.  Some history.  I had previously used a 21"" Mitsubishi 91TXM [aperture grill model] since 1996 till this year when it started flaking out and fluctuating in brightness.I decided to get my feet wet in the LCD world in March 2002 with the best bang for the buck 15"" monitor at the time.  That was the KDS Rad-5.  The KDS performed admirably; it showed me the wonders of no more eye strain when using a TFT monitor.  Some niggling concerns emerged over time of course w/ an entry level monitor like this: there was no portrait swivel [though I did splurge for a stand alone stand that does it], no DVI connection, 35ms refresh rate, colors were not as saturated and vibrant as a CRT.I had been monitoring the 19"" LCD segment for some time, waiting for an appropriate price point / performance convergence.  That came when I saw the multiple award winning Samsung 191T hit [money].  Monitors are about the only things I tend to buy locally, and my CompUSA had a few of these.  So I carted it home, pleasantly amused that I could carry it briefcase style in one hand, remembering my battles moving around of the 21"" Mitsubishi.  After unpacking, I connected the cables up to my Matrox Parhelia 512.  The Matrox has a DVI output which allowed me to go straight Digital to Digital w/out the need for an analogue conversion step.  I hooked up my KDS to the second head of the Parhelia and the third head to my Apex 20"" TV.First thing I noticed after getting the drivers installed was w/ the DVI connection, all monitor adjustments including color temp. are \'taken care of\' for you. &lt;g>  I knew this obliquely from reading all the reviews, you cannot alter geometry and other settings in DVI mode.  That\'s fine because, damn, it looks good.The 191T\'s native resolution is 1280x1024x32x60HZ.  I have never run at 1280 before because on my Mitsubishi it made things too small and caused even more eye strain.  I was leery about how things would look on the TFT since the KDS runs at 1024x768 natively which I also use to run the Mitsu.  However, my fears were unfounded, the text looks great, it\'s still 96DPI in WinXP but I don\'t have any problem reading it on the 191T which is great.Second thing I noticed compared to the KDS was that the colors were extremely vibrant and saturated.  This was a gripe w/ the KDS.  The contrast on the 191T is 500:1, on the KDS it\'s 350:1 so this is very noticeable in Mame32 vertical games where if you play in landscape mode, you\'ve got the two black \'letterbox\' bars on each side of the image.  The Samsung is brighter than my CRT, it\'s really beautiful to watch a game with strong colors like the CPS2 Vampire series, or Last Blade.Another claim to fame for the 191T is its super thin bezel, as can be seen in these images, it\'s extremely elegant and well laid out.  The base allows for rotation so games can be played in portrait mode if desired.  Sad to say, I actually find myself being too lazy to actually rotate it; so they\'re played in the old style in landscape. &lt;g>Refresh times are spec\'ed at less than 25ms. The lower the refresh rate, the less likely the ghosting effect that continues to plague LCDs to some degree.  I found the 191T to be little better than the KDS, the degree of betterness, heh, perhaps affected by the larger amount of pixels that need to be pushed around.  All said, it\'s personal preference and tolerance level for the ghosting, I don\'t think it\'s that bad since I only play Mame32 and Links 2003, a golf game which is static.I have been extremely impressed with this monitor so far, I\'ve quickly gotten used to having more onscreen real estate in my daily work as well.  The jump from 1024x768 to 1280x1024 affords a nice increase in visibility.  This monitor is a current top performer in its bracket, I don\'t have any trouble recommending it.',)"
"('*** SURGEON\'S WARNING: Reading this might lead you to purchase a near-four digit display even by maxing your card so read it at your own peril ***I have been using a 19"" CRT(18"" viewable Hitachi 753) for the last four years with a DELL: a couple of days ago, I had enough of the dry eyes from its constant use, so I sold it and got the 191T(under-pressure splurge?). It was sad to see it go(like selling a child...) and the purchase of such an expensive item on decisions made alone from the internet reviews was a very very tense experience(well, there aren\'t many stores that has the expensive LCDs displayed with all those cheaper LCDs around). HOWEVER, after a days use of the 191T, I can tell you this: get this if you can.This is one \'huge\' monitor in terms of the screen size: there has been only an inch increase from my previous monitor, but coupled with about 1/5 of the depth of the monitor, it really looks like a floating picture frame. There seems to be one dead on the top left but disregardable, and brightness(500:1) was so good that I had to turn it down: I later found out that the initial setup for the two had been at only 50%! The colors are lusciously vivid: it is not like that poking, somewhat tiresome sharpness that CRT displays. I liked the tone of the colors so much that I got some post-impressionist drawings(Monet et al) as my new screen saver. By the way, the screen\'s response from fast movement was negligible: sure, some hate LCDs for slow response rate, but with 25ms(that is milliseconds), the 191T has the one of the lowest to date and it shows. Skipping all the technical specifications that you readers by now will know(after scrolling through all the internet sites), the price might be somewhat hard to swallow: I was-[$$$] purchase was not an easy one to make, more so being a student. Also, the difference between saying \'a few hundred dollar monitor\' and \'a thousand dollar monitor\' to onlookers(""WHAT?"") was so great, I agonized over purchasing the 191T and the lesser sibling, the 181T(18inch). Both are technically and in shape the same, besides the 191T having a 19inch screen, an adapter(the 181T incorporated it inside) and a few things. However, the price difference between the two as low as [$$$], the 191T is hard to beat. Sure, some say that 19 inch at a fixed resolution of 1280*1024 is somewhat much, but for me, it is worth it and the 191T handles it superbly. Just to let you know that just because the LCDs has fixed resolutions does not mean that they cannot show lower ones: it is just that it cannot utilize the whole screen.The looks of the 191T are fabulous: 19mm silver frame, and the compactness of the depth, the lightness(the 19"" CRT was as heavy as a baby elephant, whereas the 191T is as light as a dame), and the joy of staring at the whole new world of colors without pains from lengthy use is just dazzling and wonderful: hey, I do have a 14"" LCD on my 4-year old laptop and UC Berkeley has tons of LCDs here and there so this is not my first LCD experience, but the 191T is just it. At prices now coming below [$$$] for 191Ts compared to other 18""(yes, 18""!) LCDs that costs more(i.e. NEC-Mitsubishi), the 191T(and also 181T) are the Lexuses of the LCDs: affordable luxury. It is just flat out brilliant, literally.',)"
"('SOUND ...The quality of sound is good. It does lean a good bit toward the bass end  (and I wished it didn\'t, but that\'s the way it is). I guess today\'s market has stronger preference for more bass. I\'ve had a few other headphones and based on that (and reviewers of various other products), I expect this is about as good as sound is going to get for this price. I looked here at other products (in search of more upper range, less bass) and I didn\'t see anything reviewed at this price that looked more promising.CORD...Ok, the cord IS really long. I measured it at 10 2/3 feet. They ought to just have a jack in the headset to accept a 1/8"" stereo mini-phono male plug. Then the owner could use the long wire ... or any wire he/she wished to use. And could stow it in any convenient way he/she pleased. (I\'d use one of those retractable zip-keepers--there\'s aScosche IU3.5RC 3.5mm Retractable Cablethat sells for five smackers right here on Amaz.)KEEPER...The wrap-around wire keeper isn\'t small either. I measured that at 4"" long x nearly 2"" wide x just under 1"" thick. The keeper has little \'nicks\' at each end for pushing each end of the wire into to keep them in place. That\'s going to wear the wire out over time, if you push the same spot of wire in/out of the nick. It\'s got a thin plastic belt clip molded into the back of it. Go ahead and use it, cuz I\'d like to know how long it takes before you bend over, put the keeper in a bind ... and snap that clip right off. Thank goodness they remembered to slap the word SENNHEISER across it in really big print. I was afraid they\'d forget about that.EARPADS...The over-the-ear does a good job of keeping sound out. I can barely hear the TV in the next room. Not 100% isolation, but more than enough in normal environments. An airplane, though, who knows? The earpads are comfortable enough out-of-the-gate. These are for the office, so they won\'t see much extended wear requiring serious comfort over the long haul.BRIDGE...The bridge over the head, well, it\'s a tight fit. Not really uncomfortable ... yet ... but it could be looser. I\'ve had other headphones where the bridge had far move \'give.\' Either built in via an slide in/out part or just more flexible plastic. Perhaps this unit will develop more \'give\' over time. The earpieces do slide a bit up and down (on their connections to the bridge) to allow some adjustment. I immediately pulled them all the way down. If you have a larger head and you want to absolutely assure a fit that\'s not overly snug, look elsewhere.DURABILITY...Other posters complained of durability issues, so be forewarned. At this price, though, they\'re practically disposable.BOTTOM LINE...You\'re not going to find anything worth having for less than this price, and these seem to be a good value for your money. Go for it.',)"
"(""Bought this product for the following applications:1) Playstation 3 GamesPrimarily use these headphones for Rocksmith. Prior to purchase, I was using inexpensive Sony and JVC open headphones which presented two problems. First, the volume was too low when they were directly connected to the Playstation. I could turn up the volume to max on my guitar to hear my own sound but the game music and voice announcements were barely audible. Hooking up the Sennheisers easily doubled the volume, allowing me to turn down the guitar volume which now blends much better with the Rocksmith audios. I also bought an E6 amp which improved the sound slightly but have been usually playing without. Our home is very open with a cathedral loft where I play while my wife reads or watches TV below. The headphones effectively blocked the TV audio.2) iPod 6thGenLike to use my iPod nano and shut out the home noise while listening. These headphones amazed me with their sensitivity and how much volume I could crank out of my teeny nano 6th gen. I have some high frequency hearing loss so I will allow others to comment on the overall performance but I was able to hear things I was missing. For example, Sarah Brightman's vibrato really jumped out at me. It was there before but I had just missed it in the past. Again, although I used the E6 it was unnecessary. However, I'm going to keep it. If I crank the iPod down and the E6 up it should help me extend listening time.3) LaptopOccasionally, I'll plugin while working at the computer although after hearing how great the Sennheisers sound I'll probably be doing it more often. In this application, as well as the above, the coiled cord on these Sennheisers give you nice range and flexibility without the tangles or cords stuck under the desk chair. Volume was acceptable on both laptops I own. Again no need for the E6. However, both PCs have high quality DAC and are marketed as entertainment devices.4) Receiver and CD playerTried both the Sony receiver output and Sony 5 disc player component. Make sure the volume is turned down on the receiver or the Sennheiser's sensitivity is going to blow your ears out. The disc was another matter and if I used this output I would probably need to use the little E6. Come to think of it, I'll have to check the manual and remote on the Sony. There may be volume control.5) GuitarTried a direct plug into my electic since the Sennheisers come with a neat little 1/4 inch adapter. Problem - the adapter is stereo and the guitar is mono so you'll hear only the left channel. Also, the volume isn't loud enough. But pumping it though my little personal guitar mounted amp the sound was plenty loud, and plenty clear, a big improvement over earbuds or open headphones.6) TVPerfect but I'll need a 15 foot extension cord for it to be effective.This is not my first set of closed headphones but in previous units the heat buildup was very uncomfortable. Strangely, these were comfortable for me to wear for an entire day of listening on all these devices and the audio was far superior to the previous ancient Koss headphones I chucked several years ago. In addition, I have a wide head. Opticians never carry lens frames wide enough for me to wear in the sample cases. I was concerned by several reviews that indicated this was an issue but these Sennheisers are adjustable both in width and depth. I could actually adjust them to be comfortably loose at my desk or tighten them to grip firmly while standing and moving with the guitar.I was surprised by the overall value and had expected them to be only acceptable in certain environments, perhaps excelling only with a receiver. The ability to use these in every situation makes this an incredible value. Very happy with my purchase!"",)"
"('If you\'re like me, once you find something you like, you keep it for a while and enjoy. For years I had been milking an older open ear pair of Sennheiser phones while on the air but they tended to feed back anytime I had the mic open and audio level up. The right side cable had a make and break so I decided to go shopping and found the 280 at a ""hardware show"". My first impression was how well the treble and bass punched through but mids and upper mids were very clear. Almost too punchy but, hey, you can always dial back some of those things at home on your system or lower the volume when you can\'t. The clarity was even better for my diminished hearing. It\'s bad enough when the middle age starts to diminish certain frequencies in the spectrum, unequally, but worse when you had exposure to loud noise sources and didn\'t take preventative measures to protect you hearing in younger years. I know the young guys who pin the volume through their ear buds will really be sorry for this later on. They just don\'t know it yet, but I digress. The 280 really shines in hearing situations like mine but the overall quality in audio and across the spectrum is fantastic and I think good for every listener. One of their best yet. I did appreciate the other, more costly Sennheiser products similar to the 280 but decided for me, the lack of difference in sound but much higher price answered the question quickly. Comfort: The band around the top of the head can start to feel like it is cutting in after a while and the cushions can feel a little warm or moist. Small nit pics but noticeable. Compared to the Beats, Skulls, and a couple of other products, Sennheiser has a winner and it will take a lot beat it, especially for the price. I highly recommend them. If it weren\'t for the minor comfort issue with the band, I\'d give it a 5 star. Small niggle you can live with most likely Still the audio quality is among the best and for the money? Slam dunk!Disclaimer: This is an objective subject. Your experience may be different. This is only a personal opinion and not a venue for debate. Please be respectful accordingly.',)"
"('These are excellent quality phones for the price and are  also quite comfortable to wear. Nice reproduction over the entire audio range.',)"
"(""Edit: The guy at Rat Sound discovered many of the HD280's problems are caused by the flimsy cheap driver housing that vibrates and resonates except when something solid is placed against the housing.  This headphone's driver housing needs a re-design with either higher density or thicker plastic, or with (even better) magnesium alloy.  The driver in it is capable of good performance.----Original review:I compared them today back to back. I've heard the Sony many times in the past, even owned them for a brief time. Senn had deeper bass, but a dip in the upper bass and a touch wooly in one or two midrange spots. Sony, while it didn't go as deep, lacked any significant dips or wooly aspects from the upper bass to the low treble. The Sony was still potentially a touch too bright, and when the material allowed that brightness to shine though those highs could get hard, especially on dynamically-compressed (I don't mean mp3s) recordings... maybe even harsh. In the past, I found them a lot more harsh, but maybe my hearing isn't what it used to be. The Senns treble, though not quite as bright or at all hard, was still a touch bright over neutral and could be a tiny tizzy or fizzy or something.  Not hard, not harsh, but lacking precision.  Neither headphones had amazing extension up top or sparkle, but they were both about average in that respect. Neither had fantastic micro-dynamics throughout and both headphones tended to flesh out different frequency regions of low-level detail more than the other. Sony still seemed a little glassy in the mid-band, but its flatness there more than made up for it. The Senns had nice micro-dynamics in the lows, but its upper bass suck-out prevented it from fully exploiting that lack of distortion. This also contributed to a lack of apparent tightness. Sony has the upper bass and while you'd expect that taught quality to shine completely through, its inferior micro-dynamics down there prevented it from fully exploiting it. Still, that Sony upper and mid bass had fair separation when there were obvious layers and didn't blur them into mud, even given this characteristic or its lack of the lowest octaves. The Senn was a touch more open and spread out in imaging, but lost some of the immediacy and engaging quality the Sony grabs you with. I found neither great or fully flat & extended, and both had their strengths and weaknesses. With the appropriate material or sources to match its strengths, the Sony was the easy winner... but you had to be aware of its quirks and limitations. The Senn was more tolerant of material & sources, but never soars as high, metaphorically speaking.  The Sony might range from a 5 to 8 in sonics, while the Senn hovers more safely in the 6-7 range... if that makes sense.  It did go very low, was more forgiving of high frequencies, and isolated better.  The Sony wins on durability, though, as there is a body of complaints on hinge or headband breaks with the Senn."",)"
"('I don\'t write reviews unless I am exceptionally impressed, for the good or the bad.  I am pleased to be writing this review.The Sennheiser HD-280 Pros arrived and after the first couple of weeks I am quite impressed with both the quality and design.  I was concerned when reading several comments on the snug fit, stating it was designed for a narrow head.  I wear a size 7 3/8 hat and I find the set fits very well.  It is snug but no more than is necessary for a proper fit.  My other concern was wondering if these would measure up and if I should be looking for something in the 500 series.  I decided to stay with a closed-back and these fit the bill nicely.These are my first headphone purchased ""blind"" and I have to admit I was concerned.  I am a ""try before you buy"" guy.  I stepped outside my comfort zone and gave it a shot.  I was not disappointed.These have a much clearer sound with deeper lows and crisper highs than my Audio-Technica headphones.  I recently listened to a recording of J.D. Sumner, best known as the bass singer for the Stamps Quartet and having toured with Elvis Presley.  He is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for his solo recording of the hymn ""Blessed Assurance"". According to Guinness, the song contained the lowest recorded note ever produced by a human voice, a ""double low"" C.I was anxious to hear his bass voice on my new headset and it did him every bit of justice.  I heard vocal depths I had not before heard.  It was as if somebody turned on the light switch.I have always used, as my audio unit of measure, the sounds of the acoustic piano and the vocal accoutrements of a good Southern Gospel quartet singing a cappella.  It is how I have chosen which electronic keyboards were quality and is the audio track I take with me when buying equipment and speakers.  The HD-280\'s produce a clear tone in the lower, middle and upper registers without muddying or blurring the tones, neither does it produce sounds too sharp.Whether you are listening to B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k or Ol\' Blue Eyes, Southern Gospel or Jazz, Classical or Country or anything in between, these can handle the acoustics for even the most discerning ear.And yes, just as it makes the good notes sing, those sour notes will land with an echoless thud.The around-the-ear design is comfortable and the pads are quite sufficient.  The speaker placement within each cup provides a sound that is set back from the ear enough so as not to have that in-the-ear sensation one gets from earbuds and even many headsets.  The sound surrounds rather than attacks.A feature I particularly enjoy about these headphones is the included 1/4"" plug adapter.  It doesn\'t just plug on (which we all know will eventually begin falling off over the years).  Sennheiser has adapted a screw-on feature to keep it securely attached.  A minor feature but appreciated none the less.Don\'t forget these offer user-replaceable components making them that much less disposable.Comfort and quality.  I recommend this product with a 4 1/2 stars (nothing is perfect).',)"
"('I have big head. Those are too tight. Bass is not impressive.',)"
"(""One of the charms of headphones is that they're a lazy person's no-brainer technology.  No programming, digital settings, or instructions are necessary to using, benefitting from, and evaluating the product.  Consequently, I now have along with broad experience in cans more of them than I require.  The only pair I've been absolutely and completely satisfied with are the Sennheiser PX100's, which can be transported safely in a back pocket and worn and enjoyed interminably.  But they do require careful folding and storing, and I thought the top-rated (by Cnet) HD-497's would be handier for my studio work at the radio station.A few observations about comfort.  They're light enough but also just a trifle tight--something you certainly notice after the first hour of wearing them.  Any of these phones that sit on the edges of your ears are likely to produce heat and sweat after a limited amount of time.  This is as true of the 497's as of my heavier Sony MDR V-600's.  For extended listening, the best bets are extremely lightweight phones like the PX100's, which don't sit on the &quot;rim&quot; of the ear, or phones that completely encircle the ear.  I've got some heavy, loose-fitting Panasonic RP-HT660's that can be worn for hours because the weight is on your head, not your ears.I can't speak to the durability factor of the HD-497's, though I'm somewhat surprised to see how tightly-fitting the detachable speaker wires are.  Whether they would save you a broken set of headphones in the event of tripping on the cord (I've lost one pair that way) remains to be seen.  Also, I've discovered no shorter wires made available by Sennheiser, so the detachability factor appears to be no more than a slight advantage.  As for convenience, these phones can't be folded and stored in a little storage bag, like many of their larger competitors, so I wouldn't judge them to be good travelers.As for the most important consideration, they sound great.  Adequate bass (with no sense of artificial &quot;boost,&quot; like the more expensive Sony's) and clear, brilliant highs (discernibly brighter than those of the Sony V-600's).  They're a tad more efficient (louder) than the PX-100's, and they tend to bring mid-range instruments--the piano, for example--more forward in the mix.  Indeed, the sound is transparent, clear and crystalline.  Still, I almost prefer the more democratic balance of the PX-100's, which place you mid-center instead of front-center in the concert hall.  The HD-497's are great for shorter listening episodes, but for going the distance, give me the PX-100's any day.  (They're also 25% less expensive.  For that matter, the Sony CD-180's, at one-quarter of the price, compare quite favorably in every respect with the HD-497's, with diminished treble being the major difference.)"",)"
"('I\'ve made several tentative forays into the world of ""universal"" remotes.  All have disappointed for one reason or another.  I was convinced truly universal remotes were only the playthings of fabulously wealthy people who could drop hundreds of dollars on a top-of-the-line model.Not so.  This remote IS universal.  Well, universal for the 6 components I want to control, two of which are ""off-brand"" DVD players (Oppo and Protron).Drawback:  The library of codes is so outdated that I wasn\'t able to program any of my devices using them.  It recognized my Sharp Aquos TV only after the tedious process of searching code by code.Perk:  It learns from other remotes so easily that I was able to fully customize button placement from the beginning, rather than seeing which buttons the manufacturer thought should be which and having to decide to change them or not.  I only had trouble teaching it one function, my JVC receiver volume.  Customer service was friendly and helpful.  The fix was as simple as trying different distances between the two remotes.I was able to program all the essential TV and DVR functions onto one page, so the only reason to change components is for DVD watching.  Very nice!Unlike the other remotes I\'ve tried in this price range, the LCD buttons are fully editable.  I was led to believe this feature was also only available in higher-end models.Sure, the Logitech Harmony is much prettier.  It also sounds more complex, and the more complex you get, the more potential problems you have.  The MX-500 isn\'t as high-tech, but it definitely gets the job done, which is all I want.  Actual universality!Slightly off-topic, in reading reviews for this remote I was struck by how many users made comments in the vein of ""So simple even the little lady can use it!""  While this is true, I have to wonder what kind of space-age consoles they were using before that eluded the intelligence of the average woman.  Perhaps if they gave her a chance to touch the remote once in awhile, it would remove some of the mystery.',)"

"('Overall, a small, easy to carry feature packed camera. Subject Tracking AF and Area AF make it easy to stay locked onto a subject that\'s moving so you can take a clear picture. The 110,000 pixel LCD display provides a crisp clear image. The optional RC-3 remote control allows you to tripod mount the camera and take self-portraits--if you think being able to do that is worth the [money]for the remote.A customer from San Diego, CA USA claimed that the F100 \'did not have ""time stamp"" option which will allow customer to put date on picture automatically\'. Actually it does. Under Manual mode, Menu->Custom 2 tab, there\'s an option called ""date imprint"". Turning it on sticks the date on the photo automatically. This option applies to manual mode, but you can still configure manual mode with the menus to be mostly automatic anyway. Why so many complain about features a device doesn\'t (appear to) have without bothering to read the manual first, eludes me. Besides, why ruin a good picture with a big DATE STAMP when the camera records all of the image details in the jpeg file? With the software included, it\'s very easy to see the time, date, capturing device settings and dozens of other jpeg properties after the fact without compromising the photo.The fact that Minolta doesn\'t include an AC adapter is a kicker because the AC-6 adapter costs a hefty [amount]. If you happen to have a card reader which is a better option than the USB cable anyway (go ahead and buy the 6-in-1 type so you can read anything), the adapter really isn\'t that important unless you like putting up slide shows on TV with the included A/V adapter cable.Minolta was one of the few companies who considered customer convenience in this design--they wisely chose to use AA batteries. Olympus is one of the few manufacturers to use AAs in most of their models. Most cameras I reviewed in the 4MP range use those ridiculously overpriced proprietary Li-Ion batteries. If you happen to be overseas without a charger that supports alternate voltages (a situation I\'m in frequently), you\'d better take a spare, and plan on paying around [money], or foot the bill for a dual-voltage charger if you can even get one. On top of that, you\'ll be lucky if you get 2 years out of the stupid things, and then you\'re out another [money] or so if the manufacturer even still makes them by that time. Minolta eliminated all of this pain by using standard off-the-shelf good old [inexpensive] AAs in the F100. Buy a few NiMH to carry around and keep a couple of lithium AAs with you to use if you run out of charged NiMH batteries. Worst case, stop at a gas station and load up on Alkaline AAs. They\'ll have a shorter life, but at least your camera still functions! If you\'re looking at cameras that use proprietary batteries, think long and hard about how you might wind up without the facilities to recharge before you buy. Sooner or later, it will be a problem.The LCD is recessed which helps protect it from sharp objects sliding over the back of the camera--an unfortunate oversight on another brand which now has several scratches across the screen.The lens retracts into the camera and a cover automatically closes to protect it. No lens cap to lose, no slide cover to forget to close. This lens cover design may not protect quite as well as a heavy sliding cover on other models, but given the price, I have no intentions of using my camera as a football anyway. Keep it in a padded carry bag.One last pleasant surprise from the Minolta is the F100\'s ISO capability. Most cameras I\'ve seen go up to 400, amd nearly all use 100-200 when left in auto--including the Minolta. In manual mode, the Minolta can go as high as ISO 800. This allows the camera to take photos in surprisingly low-light situations--often without the flash! There is a tradeoff though: just as with film, the higher ISO settings result in ""granier"" images. Still, if it\'s grainy or nothing, I\'ll choose grainy.',)"

"(""When I bought a surround sound setup for my bedroom and wanted to actually place the sub woofer where it belongs and the satellite speakers where they go, I was faced with the problem that faces many men in the bedroom in this day and age. Sometimes it just isn't going to be long enough to put it where you really want to.Sure i could have returned the box but I thought i would try a workaround. I noticed that the connector port on the back of my woofer was nothing more than a standard 9 pin serial connector. I looked on the Logitech site (yes the speaker setup is logitech but this isn't an ad for them) to see if they sold an extender cable, which they did not. They also firmly state that they no of no such cable and do not support anything to extend it.Willing to take a chance as many sad desperate men are, I decided i would sacrifice my ten bucks on the off chance that it might make my cable long enough to get it into the box.miracles of miracles it did the job. I have now been using this cord every day since, it having been far more faithful to the box it is connected to than I have ever been to boxes I connect up to.there's a bit of extra length left over even should i ever move into a larger apartment or move this into my living room so everyone can enjoy it. I haven't had any sound shortages of any kind or interference.I would say that the only downside is that its an off white colour. I know a lot of people want black because they think it looks sleeker with the rest of their electronics but honestly it along with all of the rest of my speaker cables is well hidden and out of sight so it really doesn't matter. in fact, should I ever choose to relocate it into the living room, the off white will be easier to hide along the floorboards as it more closely matches the walls.I have read comments on other sites about how this cable was crap because it didn't work with the persons monitor so let be stop you there and advise you that this is NOT a monitor cable extension. though they may both have a similar shape, they are by no means cross-compatible. For that you will want a monitor cable extender instead.On the customer support side of this (for some reason too many product reviews ONLY focus on this part and ignore the actual reviewing of the product in the product reviews... go figure)Shipping was extremely affordable and prompt.

"('After researching mp3 players, reading customer reviews, and watching the net for new models over quite a few months, I was prepared to be somewhat disappointed. Perhaps because of this, I did not want to spend a lot of money. I am completely SATISFIED and HAPPY with the Memorex MPD8081. This is my first mp3 player. My player\'s main function is to let me listen to music without having to run the whole computer. It\'s connected to my Monsoon MM-702 computer speakers and the combination sounds GREAT!Mini CD\'s give you the best compromise between low cost, portability, and compatibility with the most widely available devices. This player plays mp3 format files and normal CD-DA (wav files, red book, whatever) only. If there are any mp3 files on a disk, wav files will be ignored. Disks snap onto a spindle which holds them the way a ratchet holds a socket. There is no backlight and the headphone jack does double-duty as the line output. A dial on the side regulates volume and a small switch controls dynamic bass boost. The only other side-mounted control is the sliding latch for the spring-loaded cover. Overall construction is high quality. On my unit, two small places on the side where friction inside the packaging scraped away the paint--very minor.Comes with street style headphones and three blank 210 MB mini CDs. If you use headphones you will probably want another pair. The non-adjustable headphones included may be adequate for some folks. Sound is good and noise level in the electronics is quite low. No specs are given. No software is included. There is a 4.5V input in back but no included AC adaptor. The unit powers ON via the play button on top and OFF via the stop button pressed twice. Turns off after one minute of inactivity to conserve power. No batteries are included.Controls are simple, the manual is clear, functions are intuitive and the unit behaves flawlessly. Mp3 format is the only supported format; the manual says up to 384 Kbps. Also says packet writing and multi-session are supported. I have not tested all of these. I\'ve made one CD-R with mp3\'s in five directories and one CD-RW containing only two wav files. Both work just fine. Random function is quite intelligent--on a mp3 disk all files in a directory are shuffled (no-repeat) and played before moving on to the next directory. You can fast-forward and rewind within a track for either mp3\'s or wavs. For me, so far, startup time has been very short (6 seconds for 54 songs), but the manual warns that it may take up to 30 seconds on a disk containing many mp3 tracks.Only caveats you might consider: A previous reviewer was annoyed by the slight click at the end of a song. I was concerned when I read this but I do not find it to be very annoying. Sometimes (not often) a delay between tracks interrupts the ""flow"" of a recording and that IS annoying. Side topic: don\'t purchase a bunch of ""extra length"" 210 MB cd\'s before testing them with your burner. My first CD-RW burner (Samsung) had trouble using these so I switched to ""normal"" 185 MB cd\'s. I have not tested this with my newer burner and I suspect newer drives don\'t have this problem.My review would not have been so long if I wasn\'t very happy about the product. Amazon has treated me very fairly and I praise them. I do, however, believe that product descriptions here and for other items are somewhat lacking. I highly recommend this product.(original 01-Oct-2002, additional comment 16-Feb-2003)AddendumI\'m still pretty happy with it, but I might give it only four stars now. I found others comments interesting; you have to wonder about the people who didn\'t realize it only played mini CD\'s -- perhaps this speaks to Amazon\'s sparse product blurb and single picture. The Memorex web site is woefully lacking in product information, as stated by reviewer ""gadget_guy"". Battery life is decent; get ten hours from alkalines. I would like for the cover to have less free play--it clacks a bit while buttons are being pressed.I\'ve noticed some annoying sonic \'artifacts\' generated by the player\'s built-in mp3 decoder that do not happen when I listen to the same files with the computer. I\'m going to re-encode the problem albums using a different bit rate. (One of them is Peter Gabriel\'s ""melting face"" album which is bizare enough without any help from the decoder.) Software tips: I\'ve played around with Easy CD and Nero Burning; I prefer Nero. I made the mistake of purchasing the mp3pro plug-in from ahead for $19. What good is mp3pro when hardly any device supports it? I switched to the free program called CDex for ripping audio from CDs.Regarding the inter-song gap created by the player: I began to get very annoyed at this so I searched for a way to rip/encode several tracks into a single giant mp3 file. Long story short, CDex can do the job hassle free. (Wasted a lot of time mucking with the wave editor.) If I had the disk ""Abbey Road"" I would definitely rip/encode the songs into two or three giant files. Still the best mini-CD player around from what I can tell. Yeah, the iPod is cool, but I\'d rather have a new motherboard, Pentium 4, DDR-SDRAM, etc.. for the same money.',)"
"(""You've probably already read the other review of the RP62 and been impressed by its technical guts and its impressive list of features. I'm going to run down the more experiential features of this DVD player.First things FirstAt the time of this writing, you aren't going to get this player for less than... I even tried price-matching at Sears, but couldn't find a cheaper price (by the way, if Sears carries it, they will price-match Internet prices!!!). The cons I've listed really aren't that big of a deal -- all DVD players take a few seconds to load the DVDs, the display isn't really that hard to read and the clock thing just doesn't matter. All in all the unit rocks.First Impressions and InstallationI have an HDTV-ready widescreen TV (Panasonic PT-47WX49 which I highly recommend, got it at Sears for....), so I wanted a progressive scan player. When I took the RP62 out of the box, it felt really light, and the case isn't 16 gauge steel -- it's plastic, thus the light weight. I figured after spending close to... the thing would feel substantive, but Panasonic obviously put the money to better use on the performance.After taking it out, I realized that there was two cables -- power and a combo 3 RCA (video, 2 audio) cable. I kept looking for a decent cable to use for my progressive scan output, but to no avail. Luckily I had a cable that would suffice.My biggest problem to begin with was that the RP62 out of the box only operates in analog (S-VIDEO or RCA), so you have to hook it up to your non-component input on your TV first. I didn't know this, so it took me about 45 minutes to finally get the unit pumping out a progressive signal. Once that was fixed, it was time to play.CalibrationI never had a widescreen TV before, so I got the Avia Home Theater Guide to set up my TV. Complex menus, lots of levels. The player was able to do everything on the disc flawlessly. I didn't really change anything on the DVD player beyond the progressive out setting.First MoviesWow! The Matrix is one of my favorite movies, and the reproduction was amazing! I got the Matrix on DVD back in late 1999 or early 2000, so it is one of the first prints. Later I watched Jimmy Neutron. Everyone says how amazing the picture will be if you are watching it on a wide-screen progressive scan TV. Well, they weren't lying. The color reproduction was amazing. Movement was crisp and fluid, blacks were black and whites were white, as they should be.I also burned a CD full of MP3s (156 of them, all at varying and variable bit rates) and played it at a party. The player nicely randomized all of the tracks, and displayed the ID3 Artist and Title tracks on the video out. It didn't have any problems playing VBR or high bit-rate MP3s. Pretty darn cool.In the first fast forward level, it plays the video at 2x speeds but also plays the audio. It's not a perfect reproduction, but a nice feature for those who don't have a lot of time to watch a whole movie!When you turn the unit off, the video out fades out, which is a cool little effect. Not a feature I'd buy on, but cool nonetheless.Small Annoying ThingsEvery good thing has its bad sides. Granted, this player doesn't have many, but there are a few.First, every time you use a DVD for non-16:9 content, a message pops up on the screen telling you that the content is 4:3. Ok, I don't care. Maybe I can turn those messages off, but I haven't found a way yet, and maybe you can't. But they can be just a tiny bit annoying.Next, on MP3 playback, the display only shows the time, whereas the MP3 info is displayed on the video out. This is OK if you have a direct-view TV, but for rear-projection TVs, that kind of constant, non-moving video can cause burn-in. I'd like to see the MP3 info displayed on the LCD on the front, the big DVD logo gone after 1 minute of MP3 play, and the info window to move around on the screen. Heck, build in a nice WinAmp like screensaver! :-)Last, the documentation that comes with this amazing little device is lacking. I'd like to see a whole book on all the cool features of my DVD player, but Panasonic seems to have spent the money more on the features in the player than explaining them in a manual, which is OK with me.A Ton Of Positive EnergyPanasonic has a great, responsive tech support. I called about my installation issue and, though I got it fixed before they got on the phone, no more than 5-10 minutes was spent on hold or getting routed to the right place. For a company as big as Panasonic, I was impressed. The people also know enough about their products to help the simple to semi-difficult issues.For the money, the quality of this and a lot of other Panasonic electronics is really amazing. I've had a Panasonic shelf stereo since 1992, and it still works great 10 years later after lots of college abuse and 7 moves!So who is this really for?This is one of the better, low-end progressive-scan DVD players on the market right now. Audio/Videophiles will find the quality, video and audio reproduction more than acceptable at this price level. Casual electronic enthusiasts with a nice progressive-scan-capable TV will really enjoy both the video and audio output of this device. People considering getting a nicer TV in the future will find this device a solid investment, and a great player until then.Not ever going to get a progressive-scan-capable TV? Not going to use the MP3/WMA/VCD/SVCD capabilities? Have a 13-inch TV? This is probably more than you need to be spending on a DVD player! There are decent, sub....DVD players on the market that will suit you just fine. But for those of you that want progressive scan, amazing image reproduction with very few (unnoticeable to the untrained eye) flaws, the ability to play practically any CD or DVD, and the features (Zoom, enhanced Bass, virtual surround sound, quick replay, audio fast forward), you can't get a better DVD player. Buy this one!"",)"
"('I\'ll admit to [1]: Being a more-frequent than average AM station listener; [2]: Owning a plethora of radios [high-performance, specialty, and simple utility] while being a stickler for reception and audio performance - AM band NOT excluded; and [3] on my way to owning FOUR of these AM loop antennas - obviously, I\'m a satisfied REPEAT customer!Many reviewers here have well-described the operation of this product, and elaborated on how-well it works - or doesn\'t work.  In many cases, this antenna will be interfaced in a non-wired [inductively-coupled] mode - that\'s tech-speak for ""you don\'t have to hook it up"".  Actually, this is a preferable scenario in most [BUT NOT ALL] cases.  SOME radios are difficult to interface in this manner... The culprit IS NOT THE TERK ANTENNA - rather it is likely the internal electrical design of the radio\'s AM antenna and circuitry.  Sorry, it\'s simply a ""hit \'n miss"" proposition; so save your receipt if your intention is to assist but one defiant radio!EVERY portable and ""boom-box"" I own benefited at varied degrees - many substantially.  The three top contenders in the premium table radio class - the Boston Acoustics Receptor; Sangean WR-2; and Tivoli Model One exhibited a noticeable to dramatic leap in AM reception with the addition of this antenna.  The first two are no slouches on the AM band to begin with, but were well-assisted by this accessory... Generally, the greatest improvement will occur on a less-sensitive receiver.  The analog-tuned Tivoli literally morphed from ""near-deaf"" to a superlative DX-class radio with exceptional audio quality by merely setting the Terk atop its wood cabinet [see my review of the Model One here at Amazon].  Generally, high-powered home-audio center and surround-sound components, whose metal cabinets and noise-generating digital audio processor chips mandate an external wired loop antenna, are trickier propositions.  In this case, Terk provides a second option...The AM-1000 Advantage may be WIRED DIRECTLY to a receiver\'s external AM antenna terminals [if provided], but I have had mixed results - and maintaining correct polarity IS ESSENTIAL.  In the cases of my costly ICOM R71a AM/shortwave receiver [with no internal AM antenna], Carver TX-11b with ""hi-fi"" audio-bandwidth AM stereo, and Denon TU-660 designed for quality AM audio - the results were satisfactory; yet connection to my Sony home theater receiver yielded less-impressive results - the provided Sony loop antenna in some cases worked better!  Again, you\'re mileage will vary.Aside from an increase in AM signal focused on the radio, there are TWO additional seldom-discussed improvements offered by this external antenna... In an electrically-hostile environment, the loop may be oriented to ""trap noise"" and decouple it from your radio\'s internal antenna - thus lowering the offending interference.  Additionally, this antenna\'s built-in selective tuning may be slightly-varied on stronger stations - changing inductance and tricking the tuner\'s audio bandpass filter into yielding increased bandwidth - and thus audio quality... The Terk AM-1000 can actually make a stronger AM station SOUND BETTER than your radio\'s internal circuitry was optimized to allow!There are only two competitive products that offer an increase in ability to grab and focus very-weak AM signals... The $70 Select-A-Tenna has slightly-higher performance [at nearly TWICE the price] and is downright UGLY!  The $100 TCF AM antenna from C Crane offers the ultimate in performance and flexibility, but has a constant appetite for 9-volt batteries [or a noise-inducing AC power source] and is complicated and cumbersome.  I\'ll give the Terk AM-1000 Advantage my well deserved five-star rating for its utility, simplicity, attractive aesthetics, and value.',)"
"(""This remote can be set easily to take the place of many different remotes.  By using a code, or getting firmware by phone, you can set your remote to work with many devices.  I have it set to work with my TV, my DVD player, my VCR and my STB.  I can even set a button to turn on my TV, select the DVD player as the source, turn on the DVD player, and leave the remote ready to control the DVD player, but with functions such as volume and mute still controlling the TV.  If there are a few missing buttons, or you need to change the function of a particular button, it can learn that function from your original remote.  But the memory has an undocumented limit that is rather small.  The remote will work with a small number of custom keys per device.On the other hand, there is no built in support for my STB.  I was able to add the basics, but I ran out of memory after I squeezed in the power, channel up, and down buttons. That's good for most day to day activities, but I need to keep the original remotes around for things such as setting up, etc.I have an HDTV also, and there is no code for it.  Even if there is firmware available for it, the remote is not really designed for HDTV.  For example, there is no decimal point key on the keypad.  So if I want channel 6.2, I don't have a clue how new firmware will help.  I could map it to the record button on the VCR/DVD area, since it has a dot in the middle, but when you remap too many keys, it gets confusing.  You need to remember what L1, L2, etc do, since that's what the programmable buttons say.  HDTVs will also have a button for aspect ratio (screen format) and others that are not on the remote.My very simple OEM remote has CC, SAP, picture, sound and CLOCK buttons. It also has a freeze button, which could be mapped to the DVD area's pause button, which is again confusing. There's also a view and check mark button, and I can do without them. But I can't do without the dot, unless I go to the wrong channel on purpose and use the up or down button. I can't make simple adjustments to the picture or sound qualities, and I can't adjust it for wide screen and 4 by 3 sources, unless I want to map buttons that are far from obvious. And that does not leave me with enough buttons.  If I mapped the format button the fast forward button, I suppose it could work, but that's getting beyond the point of silly.  I'm better off keeping two remotes, since all I have in my bedroom is a DVD player and HDTV, but this remote can't even handle that reasonably.On the other hand, it handles my family room setup better than I expected.  I still have some esoteric equipment that is not programmed in, but I'm not surprised that an Adcom GSA700 or GDD1 are missing. But as somebody else pointed out, with a simple cable and a moderate amount of time, I could add those devices, or at least the basic functions of them, since the keys are even more specialized than on a TV.If there were something else on the market that was similarly priced, had a touch screen, and allowed a user to change button text descriptions, then I'd say that this falls short.  But there does not seem to be anything at any price from major remote manufacturers that gets around the limits of this product, so it's a remarkable unit for the price point.  Still, it's been around many years, and should have been updated with one more simple row of buttons to take care of things I mentioned that are now on the most basic of remotes."",)"

"('*** Note: Several recent comments have stated that this product no longer comes with a worldwide voltage input (100-240V) power supply.  That\'s a shame, and I\'d definitely knock a star off the review if I could due to this change on D-Link\'s part -- I can only imagine it was part of a cost-cutting move. :-((Note that this review was originally posted in 2005, so it\'s been a LIFETIME for an electronic device and the DUB-H7\'s you buy today are likely quite dissimilar insofar as their physical construction goes compared to the ones from 2005.)Original review:I\'ve had one for about six months now, and it\'s worked without problems.  One of the things I particularly like with it is that it comes with one of the newer ""slimline"" power supplies that doesn\'t block other plugs, works anywhere in the world (100-240V), and is more efficient than the old ""wall wart"" power supplies.Let me address some of the other comments here:1) For the guy with the Lexar data card... it is a blight on D-Link\'s reputation that their technical support was clearly incompetent (this is sadly true of many companies today -- being pushed there in part by the relentless ""drive to the bottom"" by consumers who often care more about price than quality and support), but I doubt that even a really good company could have helped much.  Although the hub may have somehow been at fault, it\'s also possible the Lexar card had problems -- even if it worked fine in other hubs.  For the record, I\'ve used a handful of USB drives with this hub without problems... although not a Lexar brand.2) Regaridng plugging in a USB 1.0/1.1 device and slowing the hub down -- this doesn\'t actually happen, at least in the hub I received, but what D-Link is doing is hedging their bets (hence the word ""may"" -- which unfortunately these days many manufacturers use when the word ""will"" is more correct!): Inside the hub you\'ll find a VERY generic hub IC (actually, two of them), and D-Link has a lot of freedom to use different vendors\' ICs based on price, availability, etc.  All of them are USB 2.0 hubs, but ones without so-called ""per port transaction translators"" will drop to full speed (12Mbps) if any of the ports have such a device plugged into them.  Happily, ICs like this are pretty much extinct today (when USB 2.0 first came out they were around).  In any case, your solution of just getting two hubs certainly still applies.  I agree this should be a little bit more prominently advertised, but so should a lot of things about USB, WiFi, etc. -- the oft-touted data routes of 480Mbps and 54Mbps (respectively) are pure fantasy, for instance, in real world applications.',)"
"('I don\'t have much to compare this product to as I am new to telescopes and just getting to know the basics.  What I can say is this kit seems like it brings out the best in an amateurs backyard space exploration.  I am absolutely positive that this is NOT the best set available on the market based off of product feedback and general knowledge but it will definitely be a nice finishing touch to those who are attempting to get the most out of their scope.  For those that are new to this and wondering what exactly everything does,  *You can probably stop reading by now if you have a general experience of how scopes/lenses/filters work*.General Information For Newbies like myself: (Don\'t trust me word for word this is only from my understanding)The barlow lens attaches to the scope that you can then place any other lens into the barlow to get essentially a 2x magnification level.The size in MM of the lens represents its magnification power.  The shorter the lens (Small MM) the more magnification.  a 13mm lens is more ""powerful"" than a 32mm lens.  (Don\'t let the physical size fool you).The planetary filters alter the contrast of the image and help show ""features"" of objects that you otherwise wouldn\'t/couldn\'t see, they also do a good job at filtering out excess light so that you can actually see what you are looking at rather than having it seem to be looking at pretty much the same object no matter what planet or star you are on (for those that have weaker scopes).The moon filter is very nice at reducing the light as described.  Makes things much more enjoyable and easy on the eye.  I noticed after viewing the moon for a while without the filter I couldn\'t see much of what was around me being so dark out. The filter really reduced that effect.Tips:  Experiment around a little, don\'t be discouraged if you can\'t get it all figured out in one night and find your way to all of the planets and stars.  As helpful as the filters can be they can also hurt.  For faint objects through a low powered scope it can make some objects barely visible at best depending on visual magnitude. Remember the smaller the lens in size and MM the bigger the power.  That also happens to mean that you might get a much more distorted/fuzzy image and objects WILL be harder to locate.  I don\'t have a fancy ""GOTO"" scope (one that finds whatever you want it to for you).  I\'ve learned through the small amount of experience that I have to start with a higher number MM lens and find what I\'m looking for and then change out the lens carefully and slowly and fine tune as needed... The 8mm and especially 6mm lenses are virtually useless to me as I haven\'t been able to get them trained and tuned on anything.  (This might be due to my ""cheaper"" scope).Final Thought: The eye relief has much room for improvement... Most of the time with the short lenses the only thing I saw was my own eyelashes... Another reason the short lenses haven\'t helped me out. (eye relief gets better with the longer lenses, and for those that don\'t know it\'s the amount of space between the actual lens and your eye).  Hence, if you have your eye pressed against the lens you might see your pretty little batty eyelashes instead of the cosmos.Good luck and see you at Saturns rings! ;)',)"

"('I got a PS101 after having very good luck with a similar D-Link DP-101P+ pocket print server. We use Macs, which the setup software does not support.No problem with the DP-101P, just used the Web Admin feature. The D-Link had a default IP address and was easy to connect to with a web browser. One-time setup with a fixed IP address. My only complaint is that the D-Link has no way to tell you what the new IP address is if you forget it. Some print servers have a button which will print a settings page when the print server is connected to a printer. There is also no reset button to return to factory defaults. Write the new IP address on the DP-101P itself so you have it handy.The Netgear PS101 is another story.1. As with the DP-101P, there is no button to print out settings, and no reset button. Even though the manual refers to a ""diagnostic button"" (print settings/reset button), which some other Netgear print servers have, there is not one.2. The default IP address does not come with the manual.The manual does not mention a default IP address. Instead it says the PS101 can come up with an IP address in a certain range:""When NETGEAR PS101 Print Server is without an IP address ... and there is no DHCP server to automatically get an IP address, it will self-assign a unique IP address. The address range is from 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.254.254""However support says there is a default IP address of 192.168.0.150.3. BUT ...you can only use the default IP address if you are not connected to a router (network) which assigns an IP address. My web browser could not access the PS101 at the default IP address when connected directly to it (computer to PS101 via ethernet cable), although that might work for some.The networks I have used normally assign computers an IP address by DHCP. This is great for computers, but does not work well for a print server. The PS101 comes setup to get an IP address by DHCP. So if you connect the PS101 to a network to use Web Admin, you cannot connect until you figure out what IP address it got assigned. Very unfriendly.4. Changing settings via web admin would not work.Netgear has some odd terminology. ""Reset"" in the Web Admin means upload new setting that you have set and ""saved"" in the Web Admin screens. When I clicked on reset I lost my web connection to the PS101, so maybe it did reset. I have not been able to tell if this works, because ...5. If you unplug the PS101 it reverts to the factory default settings. So it loses the fixed IP address you just assigned. For my purposes this effectively means I cannot use it with a fixed IP address. As noted by H. Oh in another review:""Unplugging the cord will rest the unit to the factory default.It means that you have to set it again on every power interruption.A never-heard-concept in IT industry!! ""This is ridiculous.The workaround seems to be to set your network\'s router to always assign the same IP address to the PS101 via DHCP. This involves specifying the PS101\'s MAC address in the router setup so the router knows when the PS101 turns up on the network.Netgear support spent a lot of time with me but was not able to explain the above problems or help me get the setup done. The PS101 may work OK if you have a Windows computer and can run the Netgear Setup Wizard, but even then the reset on losing power makes this a poor choice.Good luck.- Winston',)"

Don\'t call this place if you\'re on a noisy phone or don\'t have lots of time to waste. The first person I reached could barely speak english. He was obviously reading from a script, because when I explained that the router did not work, I had followed the troubleshooting guides and this was the result, etc, etc, he still started reading questions and asking me to connect it to a network and do silly tests. That\'s hard to do at work on your lunch break. He hung up very abruptly with the classic ""Thank you for calling bye bye now. &lt;CLICK>"" Call #2.

"(""I brought my brand new Finepix 3800 to Las Vegas and took about 200 pictures with it, both indoor and out, in the daytime and at night, mostly without using the flash.  The pictures came out sharp and the colors were brilliant.  My pictures of the Strip at night of the casinos are postcard quality.  For outdoor night shots, I put the camera on something solid before shooting the picture to prevent shaking, since I did not bring a tripod with me.  Most of the pictures were taken at 1/2 second with f/2.8 (Note: Fuji includes this info in the file, I only find out after loading the pictures on my computer).  When situations permit, I have also put the camera down and used the self-timer to take pictures, further eliminating camera shake.This is my very first digital camera.  My other camera is a Nikon N70 SLR, shooting pictures since the '60s with a Minolta SRT-101.  The color of a picture of an orchid taken at the Mirage was so rich, it put all of my Nikkor lenses to shame.  I also took some pictures inside St Mark's Square (indoor) at the Venetian.  The 3800 was able to produce accurately the color of the performers' costumes.  The night shots taken on top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris were fantastic.  What I am trying to illustrate is that I have no problems taking pictures in low light and how accurate the 3800 is in terms of color.Other than the small 16MB xD card, the only other problem I've found with the 3800 is that once you press the shutter to focus, the picture on the camera's LCD screen &quot;freezes&quot; and you won't see the subject moving (this was a problem shooting lion pictures at the MGM).  So you really can't focus first and take a shot even a second later.  I've bought a 512MB xD card, with it I can take up to 400 pictures using 3.2 megapixels in &quot;fine&quot; mode.  I find 3.2 megapixels just the right size, fine enough for my pictures and not too big in terms of file size.  Another must is a set (or 2) of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries.  I use a Rayovak 1 hour charger.I do wish the flash has a higher guide number, allowing it to reach a subject farther away, but then I shouldn't compare it with my Nikon SB-28 dedicated flash.  :-)Others have complained about Fuji always uses the same filenames beginning with 0001.  Some have also complained about the lens cap falling off.  I don't find either to be a problem.  I do keep the adapter ring on at all times.  It protects the camera lens from accidental scratches and the lens cap fits the adapter ring nicely.The 3800 comes with a CD-ROM.  The only software you must load is the USB Mass Storage Driver.  Once you've loaded that and connected the camera to the computer with the USB cable provided, the camera becomes a &quot;removable drive&quot; on your computer and you can use Windows or MS-DOS to copy the picture files to your computer hard drive.  It works extremely well.  The camera is also suppose to work with the Mac.The 6X optical zoom lens is mighty long.The camera is easy to use, though you do have to read the manual at least once to learn how to use all the features.  It was rated no. 1 by Consumer Report two years (2002 &amp; 2003) in a row for 3 megapixel digial cameras.  Even though the 3800 is an older model, it is still an excellent camera.  I paid $296 for it, before a $60 manufacturer mail in rebate.  It is also a great value."",)"

"('Like other reviewers I once considered TiVo to be a ""glorified"" VCR that instead of recording on tapes, digitally recorded onto a hard drive. However my eyes were opened dramatically when two years ago I moved to the DC area and met some people who not only used TiVo, but wondered how they had survived without one for so long.That was 2002 and I picked up my first TiVo just last Saturday (two years later to the day). Just three days later I am also left wondering not only how did I manage to get by so long without a TiVo, but also what took me so long?I always thought I never watched enough television to warrant purchasing a digital video recorder. I would watch and marvel at some of the features that a TiVo offers, but calculate that my viewing habits of DVDs and `Buffy the Vampire Slayer\' hardly warranted the investment.The fact is that TiVo not only allows you to make television fit into your schedule (instead of the other way around), but it also opens your eyes to other shows that you may have never come across without the features included in a TiVo. It\'s far, far more than just a glorified VCR. To compare a VCR to a TiVo is akin to comparing an abacus to a modern PC. TiVo really does revolutionize the way you watch television.Features like Wishlists, two types of guides, TiVo suggestions, season passes and a number of other features make it an invaluable tool..For example, with a VCR you can only record from the moment you decide to record something. With TiVo it is constantly recording so if you are 15 minutes or so into a show and you think ""This is cool, maybe I should record the whole thing"" then you can record from the start.Alternatively if you come into the room and the show has already started then you can rewind the television and watch the show from the start.One feature I really like is the Wishlist. TiVo calls in every week to get updated schedules for all your channels for the next two weeks. Therefore you can do searches for shows with a certain actor (e.g. Pierce Brosnan) and it will come up with all the TV shows and movies etc with that actor in it. There are also searches for directors and keywords etc etc....I already have about five or six wishlists saved.Season Pass is VERY cool. Say you love the show ALIAS. Well you can tell TiVo to record every episode of ALIAS and it will store that information and record every episode of ALIAS that it finds until you cancel the season pass. Of course you don\'t want it recording repeats so there is a setting where you tell the TiVo to only record first-run episodes.Say for example that ALIAS is on a Sunday and then repeated on Wednesdays (hypothetically speaking), the TiVo will know it recorded that same episode on Sunday so will not record it on the Wednesday. You see the TiVo has detailed information on each episode of every show on television (as well as movies etc) [that you can of course view through the different guides].Of course you may have some shows on Season Pass that clash (on at the same time). Not a problem for TiVo. You prioritize the shows in order of importance. For example I have ALIAS higher that STARGATE: ATLANTIS. So, if there is a clash then the TiVo will record the ALIAS episode.You can of course search manually for shows/movies etc through different genres.Of course there are different types of onscreen guides that you can use that are similar to the types of onscreen guides that satellite and digital cable provide.But there\'s more. You can pause, rewind and fast forward live TV (very cool). Say the phone rings in the middle of a show you are watching on TV. Just hit pause and the TV screen pauses at that point. Then when you get off the phone hit play and you can start watching from the point at which you paused it.You can also set shows to record from your office. You are sitting in your office and a colleague tells you about a show that sounds interesting, but it starts before you get home. Simple, sign onto the TiVo website and you can schedule your TiVo back at your house to record that television show.One feature I particularly like is the ability to watch a recorded show while TiVo records a different show. This is so particularly great because you never have to deal with commercials EVER AGAIN! By the time you have watched the show you were viewing you can switch to the show in progress and fast forward through all the commercial breaks - while the show is still being broadcast!TiVo is simply put the best investment I have ever made. No more flipping through channels trying to find something interesting to watch. I only watch what I want to watch and when I want to watch it.',)"

"('I bought this based on glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites dedicated to the AM DXing hobby. I&#8217;m well aware this is a &#8220;pocket&#8221; radio and all have their limitations, and being that I&#8217;ve been an amateur radio operator the past 30 years I&#8217;ve owned literally hundreds of radios both good and bad. I feel the biggest shortcoming of the DT-200X&#8217;s mediocre AM performance is the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit, It is molasses slow. It&#8217;s a shame because otherwise sensitivity and selectivity is above average for a radio in this class. I counted up to 3 seconds before the AGC recovered to normal volume during quick station fading, this can also be heard by stepping up/down the band station to station. Why is this big deal? For the average listener they may not even notice if the only stations they listen to are big kilowatt local broadcasters during the day. On the other hand, for someone trying to pull a signal out just above the noise floor the slow AGC makes it a tedious process if not impossible. Additionally, stations coming in strongly at night that take a sudden deep fade the AGC is so pronounced and slow I thought the batteries had died until the signal faded back in. Even worse, the AGC in this radio also induces some audio clipping and distortion on marginal signals or those that arrive via multipath.This is not to say the DT-200X is a &#8220;bad&#8221; radio. Most of those who would consider purchasing it for mostly FM listening and casual AM listening will be fairly pleased. I&#8217;m impressed with how uniform sensitivity is on AM. Selectivity is good without being too narrow to spoil audio quality and nulling of adjacent interference is fairly sharp when turning the radio. Audio is OK when using decent ear buds and leans towards the vocal range on AM, which is a plus. However, even though the internal speaker is primarily a utility feature, it is one of the worst I&#8217;ve ever heard - even more so than my Tecsun PL-360 which has about the same speaker size.Within the first hour of using the DT-200X I seriously considered returning it, which would&#8217;ve been a first out of many Amazon purchases. I have since had a change of heart and will live with its quirks on AM and add it to the collection. It certainly won&#8217;t be used nearly as much as my Sangean PRD-5, Sony SRF-59 and SRF-M37W. It&#8217;s really too bad, Sangean is so close to an excellent &#8220;Ultralight&#8221; performer with the DT-200X but it misses the mark with the wonky AGC and clipping in my opinion. It&#8217;s possible the DT-400W and newer CCrane AM/FM pocket portable are better choices for what I&#8217;m looking for. Maybe I got a dud?I do know I&#8217;m not willing to spend another $40+ on a pocket radio to find out.',)"
"(""This radio has attracted a cult following...often selling for almost $200.  I'm not sure if it's because of the design, or the incredible reception?  I paid $39.99 at the Sony Style Store on Madison Avenue and wish I had bought another.  It's a true shame that Sony wouldn't recognize what they had here, and continue to make this model.I have owned this radio for well over 10 years.  It has unbelievable AM reception...best I've ever witnessed.The sound quality is more than sufficient, but where it shines is AM reception.  I live in NYC, surrounded by skyscrapers, and this radio never disappoints.  In the evening I clearly bring in stations like WBZ in Boston.  It even shines when away from windows.Yes, I do wish it had more presets, but that's really nitpicking.  I own a number of clock radios, and this is by far the best.  I also own a Boston Acoustics Horizon Solo, which is known for its AM reception...and it is good.  However, it doesn't even come remotely close to the IFC-M410.  Tested side-by-side, the IFC-M410 brings in stations that the Horizon Solo could only dream about.I also own a newer Sony ICF-C1ipMK2 Clock Radio/iPod dock.  It's a nice device with a lot of features and decent AM reception...but again, not in the same stratosphere as the IFC-M410.And lastly, my Sangean RCR2 is a superb clock radio...with every feature known to man.  It has 7 am and 7 fm presets.  It has dual alarms that can both be customized to wake you up with buzzer or alarm.  You can fall asleep to one radio station and wake to another.  You can set it to wake you up on any particular day...and it's so easy to set and use.But it's not the ICF-M410.  I use rechargeable batteries and they seem to last about a week of hard, long use.Again, this is what a portable radio should be.  A shame that Sony never recognized that...and that it should still be a staple on the market."",)"

I too had problems, which took 45 minutes to finally resolve.  You MUST install the Rio Manager software, which I found disappointing. All I know is that before installing the software the machine didn't recognize it, and after a couple reboots it did.  (As a USB storage device, Windows &quot;should&quot; have assigned it a drive letter automatically.) I use other player software, which may NOW work, but I just haven't tried yet.

It worked well in that regard.This cooler has a USB powercord, but the cord terminates as a DC jack to the back of the chillmat. While some people might consider this a plus, this is the single biggest failure on this item. The DC jack INPUT on the cooler itself was poorly constructed, causing the fans to spin up and down for a while until eventually, they wouldn't spin up at all. A laptop cooler that can't spin the fans is next to worthless.However, this cooler has no channels for air and doesn't sit high enough from the table to even add airflow when the fans are off. In a very real sense, this laptop cooler is actually WORSE than simply putting my laptop on top of a book for cooling benefits.I strongly recommend other people avoid this and find a better product."",)"
"('Arguably the best Canon walk-around lens for the money if you\'re not buying ""L"" series gear.  The USM system is fast and quiet, the full-time manual focus is very helpful when re-selecting a macro target, and the image stabilizer makes for better hand-held shots at slow shutter speeds.  The physical construction has only one flaw: The lens is heavy, and much of the weight is concentrated in the front element, meaning that accidental telescoping will occur once the mechanism loosens up with use.  That\'s a ""when"", not ""if"", so expect it to happen eventually.That issue aside, it has very good image quality, offers as much zoom range as any hobby or pro-sumer photographer could reasonably demand in one lens assembly, and even produces usable high-magnification shots in the near-macro range (shown as ""Macro"" in the focus assembly\'s depth-of-field window).  The 1.6x crop factor on APS-C bodies (pretty much any Canon dSLR except for the 1Ds and 5D series) will limit this lens\' effective field of view at 45-216mm, even though the curvature and depth of field will still be 28-135mm equivalents.  That\'s a little narrow on the low end, so the EF-S 15-85mm IS USM lens and EF-S 17-55 IS USM lens should definitely be considered by all APS-C owners before making the final purchase decision, but most shooters won\'t have any problems with this lens.The lens has a 72mm filter adapter, so good-quality filters (particularly 72mm circular polarizers) will be fairly pricey.  Buyers should budget around $50-75 for a decent circular polarizer and a UV filter/lens protector.  Search ""72mm filter"" on Amazon to see a good selection.Final note: Don\'t be fooled by Amazon\'s ongoing policy of deceptive list prices for SLR gear, which they would never charge and no sane person would ever pay.  As I write, Amazon is showing a crossed-out $753.77 as the List Price for this lens, while the inflated MSRP on Canon\'s own US website is $479.99.  Amazon\'s current ""real"" price of $359.99 is very competitive, but it is not a ""52% savings"".  I\'m disappointed that Amazon\'s marketing department has so little respect for their customers, but their customer service quality remains excellent, so buy with confidence -- just be sure you know your fair market value prices before clicking through.',)"

"('I bought this lens because of Canon\'s reputation and my prior experience with their products.  I\'ll say right off that I am not disappointed.  Actually, I\'m quite fond of it and it has become my primary \'walking around\' lens.  As pointed out by numerous other reviewers the lens is quite capable of producing excellent images, especially stopped down a bit, has very good color fidelity, and sports super fast focusing with little of the \'hunting\' that bedevils too many other AF lenses. The IS is a great feature too.  I\'m generally not a big fan of zoom lenses (all my other lenses are of the fixed focal length variety) because of extra weight, mechanical complexity, and often compromised imaging capabilities.  However, this lens won me over because it doesn\'t cost a king\'s ransom (the ""L"" lenses come to mind) and is surprisingly light and small given its wide focal length range and decent low-light capabilities.But here\'s the puzzle.  As also mentioned by many reviewers, the lens suffers from ""lens creep"" where, when it is pointed downward and gravity has a chance to work, the lens will extend to its maximum 135mm focal length.  This will happen even faster, and with greater surety, when the weight of a glass filter and/or lens hood is added to the mix.  The practical result of this is that the lens, being fully extended, is more open to damage from accidental impact, and if you don\'t happen to be shooting at 135mm then you will have to re-zoom the lens every time you bring the camera to your eye.  This characteristic isn\'t a deal breaker for me, but it is odd that Canon hasn\'t come up with a simple fix.Regardless, I\'ve become accustomed to the lens creep, and find the positive features and overall quality of the lens, especially considering the low price, more than enough compensation.Yes, I would heartily recommend this lens to a friend, albeit with a bit of a disclaimer first.',)"

"('BEHIND THE NECK HEADPHONESIn short, this general ""behind-the-neck"" headphone design is the most comfortable type you can purchase. They also the best at staying in place when exercising. For me, the Maxell NB-201 headphones are VERY uncomfortable---but your head may be shaped differently.GENERIC SHORTCOMINGS OF BEHIND-THE-NECK HEADPHONESYou can buy a half-dozen different headsets which look identical except for the brandname. Some will be comfortable, some won\'t. Some reviewers rave about the comfort of models that hurt my ears. Some models which I find very comforatble are complained about by other reviewers. Apparently different folks have different shaped heads, which is important to the fit of behind-the-neck headphones, but not for other types of headphones/earbuds. So, when you find a set which is comfortable for you---buy an extra set or two and stash them.OTHER TYPES OF HEADPHONES""Top of the head"" headphones slip easily, require adjustment, interfere with wearing hats and interfere with women wearing hair ""up"". The only purpose for which a ""top-of-the-head"" headset is better, is for listening to music while taking a nap.Apple/airline type earplugs are just plain uncomfortable, fall out of your ears easily, and do not provide the noise isolation of earbuds. However, they can be adapted to earbuds.  For example Earphone Adapters - Premium, Comfort Fit In-ear Tips for iPod and other Earphones / Earbuds (Black)Earbuds, although a good choice in many situations, are uncomfortable after several hours. I suspect that the build-up of heat and moisture in your ear canals might lead to infections if earbuds are worn several hours daily.  Indeed, enough heat builds up to melt your earwax, which then solidifies in and on the earbuds.  Premium earbuds even have replaceable ""wax filters"".  If you wear non-premium earbuds, clean the earwax out regularly.ADJUSTABILTIY""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are non-adjustable because no adjustment is necessary. In fact, that is one of the advantages of ""behind-the-neck"" headsets.CORD LENGTHDespite the silly complaints of a few other reviewers that the cord is short, it is in fact the standard length---long enough for you to carry your MP3 in your pants pocket. Short is better than too long---you can always add a cheap extention, for exampleCables To Go 40405 3.5 mm Male/Female Stereo Audio Extension Cable, Black (1.5 Feet/0.45 Meters).  If the cord is too long, it will catch on things, straining the cord at the plug----which is what will ultimately kill the headset.  If you need an extension, consider an extension with a built-in volume controlKoss VC20 Volume Control.  If you can, wear the cord inside your shirt (or blouse) to prevent it snaging on things.SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality of the headphones is VERY crisp and clear, (unlike many headsets which are optimized to ""pump up the bass"" which makes voice and treble muddy).CONSTRUCTION QUALITYThe plug is straight which means that it will pull out of your MP3 player easily rather than straining the wire at the plug. Virtually all headsets ""die"" by strain on the wires at the plugs---so straight plugs are far better than angled plugs.OVERALLA very good headset for the price, albeit obviously not the equal of $100+ audiophile headsets for listening to music.MY QUALIFICATIONSI use headphones at least 12 hours per day, and have used every style which exists. Over the past 20 years, I have owned probably 50 headphones (including at least 20 behind-the-neck sets.GENERAL RECOMENDATIONS""Behind-the-neck"" headphones are the most comfortable, period. I wear ""behind-the-neck"" headphones at home/work (I work at home) about 12 hours per day. When I go ""out"", I wear earbuds, such asJBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White), because they are less obtrussive, and easy to ""put away"" if necessary. Earbuds are also useful for noise reduction in noisy environments (traffic, mall noise, etc.).

"('This lens is smooth.  It offers me so many new photo ops that I never had before.  The IS (image stabilization) is a charm.  You shouldn\'t use it with a tripod, but for the most part it does not blur the picture if you did. (Sometimes the sensor that is trying to constantly focus will move and blur the image when on a tripod. Its best to just flip the switch off and this will not be an issue when shooting) It performs well in low light, both indoors and out, and really enables you to get those shots at dawn/dusk that you otherwise wouldn\'t stand a chance at getting.An external flash will also give you extra options for shots, but if you are saving money in the short term, this lens will get those low light shots without needing to purchase an external flash as well.  Keep in mind the (IS) won\'t make every shot crisp in low light, but between using that and a tripod, you\'ll always be able to get that shot, regardless of light.I\'ve had my lens for 2 months, and I\'ve already impressed more friends and family than ever expected.  Common questions and comments you\'ll get include ""how were you able to get that shot"", ""that looks like something a professional would take"" and ""you really know what you\'re doing"".  Of course, even the nicest camera and lens cannot make you a better photographer, it only gives you the tools to do more with your creativity.Aside from having an on/off switch for the IS, you can also turn on/off the manual focus, so that if you aren\'t ready to take full control, you don\'t have to.The weight of the lens balances well with a battery grip added to the body.  (The battery grip is optional, I got mine through Opteka, and its a great addition for longer battery life and offsetting heavy lens weight.)  The overall range that it shoots makes it ideal for your every day lens.  With a 1.6x factor on an XT/XTi, you\'re actually shooting 44-216mm.  This will allow you to take your standard shots, get some great portrait photos of friends/families for those special occasions (including weddings), and also give you enough zoom to impress even yourself with the shot potential you will have available... until you find the need or the money to get that telephoto lens.  The macro setting also impressed me.  It performs surprisingly well, and will leave you smiling day after day. It is not a true macro, but will certainly zoom in within an inch of the subject.  The lens has just enough to satisfy both your zooming and macro needs, so you don\'t have to spend bundles of money on various lenses until you\'re ready to get serious.  The example photos illustrate both of these features remarkably well.This is a great purchase if you aren\'t able to jump to the L series of glass, and I\'d strongly recommend considering this as your optimal walk around lens.',)"
"('I\'m not a professional photographer in that I don\'t make money doing photography.  However, I believe I know a thing or two about the subject that has been a passion of mine since I was first introduced in middle school (yes, we used darkrooms) and many classes/books later.  I\'m a dad who wants to take pics of my little boys, some family events, and vacations - and I want those pics to be phenomenal.  If you\'re reading this, I assume you\'ve already learned the basics of this lens and where it fits in the overall Canon L-series lineup. So, as you already know, this lens is absolutely brilliant for portraits and sports, especially indoor sports and even weddings. I also assume that you are struggling between this and the 40% more pricey version with IS. But prior to getting my new bodies, I\'d never been tempted to write a review being that so much has already been said.  So what can I add?  Short answer is I can ""shed some light"" (sorry) on why IS is less necessary on the newer bodies.I can say (having owned/owning earlier generation Canon bodies) that between this and the more expensive II IS version, that now more than ever before, the additional cost of the IS version is more superflous than ever on the newer Canon bodies.  For reference I own a 70D and 6D, and also my older 5DMark II and 40D.  In upgrading, I elected against the 5D Mark III because of the lack of Wifi/GPS (remember why I shoot), and some other nits, but that\'s another review altogether.  I also elected against the IS version of this lens a while back previously because I felt I didn\'t need it - I often turn it off on other lenses to eek out that slightly last bit of, admittedly subjective, focus ""oopmh"" and ""sharpness"". To be honest, I can\'t think of when I ever actually turn it on. Cost was not a consideration whatsoever, for me at least.  It just seemed like a pointless ""feature"" that would add unnecessary heft and slightly soften images.  However, with the revised Mark II version of this lense, I began to read that maybe the image quality of the II IS version was a smidge better - and that\'s what I\'ll open up the wallet for. So, before selling my non-IS version on eBay, I decided to try it out on the newer bodies and I must say that - THIS IS NOW THE BEST VALUE/MOST USEFUL CANON ZOOM LENS PERIOD. FULL STOP!!!  Shhhhh don\'t tell to many people before the price skyrockets or Canon stops making these puppies!!Remember, IS doesn\'t stop ""shake.""  If your hands are shaky, all the IS in the world won\'t help you.  IS is to assist in reducing motion blur which usually results from a shutter that is open too long. I don\'t mean to insult most of you who already know this or to portray myself as an ""expert.""  How does one avoid using a slower shutter? Increase light. Enter the newer bodies.The 6D, for example, is able to autofocus in super low light conditions (down to -3 EV for those interested. 5DMarkIII is a full stop higher FYI).  This is a gamechanger because the low-light stability that the IS offers is even less of an issue now.  These newer bodies also have a phenomenal ISO range, with much-improved lower-noise/higher ISOs. I never had a problem with this lens before, particularly with sports and well lit indoor events.  But now, I\'m increasingly confident using this lens in lower-light situations with outstanding results and without a tripod/monopod (of course especially with a monopod, this lens is actually slightly sharper than the IS version, but again, others have noted that).But with the 70D, I think this lens really goes to a level to where I feel that, at current prices, buying this lens is robbery.  Like, I feel that someone at Canon is asleep at the pricing wheel.  This lens is a gift!!  First, there\'s the 1.6 crop factor which extend the focal length of this camera to 112-320mm.  Folks, that\'s a pretty darn useful range to capture at f2.8!!  And you get the same high quality/low-noise ISO technology.  An ISO of 1600 is actually quite reasonable ""low noise"" ISO on the 70D - above that, for me at least, is meh. But at two stops of light above 400, you can imagine what options this gives you for lower light settings without a speedlite!  More light equals faster speeds equals less room for ""shake.""  Now add the 7fps continuous shooting and the fast autofocus (a smaller factor to reduce shake) and you have a monster here.So, to be fully candid, the only situations now that one would need the IS are situations where you are likely to need a tripod/monopod anyway, thus rendering the IS totally moot.This is such a great lens.  And it bears repeating, but you already know, the bokeh is out of this world wide open. But drop down a stop and you get exquisitely sharp images. What more can you ask for???!!So if you\'ve come this far, do not think twice about buying this lens, especially if you have a newer body (although, I still think this was my best lens on the prior bodies).  It\'s a NO-BRAINER over the IS version where the IS feature is the driver.  I cannot speak extensively on the purported image quality improvement in the Mark II version - I haven\'t had the motivation to try because my images are killer with this lens.  So if that\'s your motivation, perhaps you should test that out.FYI Other lenses:24-105mm 4.0-5.6 IS85mm 1.217-55mm EFS IS lens (another star, FYI)100-400mm 4.0-5.6 IS',)"
"('I write martial arts books. It\'s a niche market, one that\'s not horribly lucrative, but that requires a lot of high-quality photos. After spending nearly $4,800 to have a professional take the pix for my first couple books I decided I\'d get a lot more bang for my hard-earned bucks to purchase some high-end equipment and do it myself. Shots include both fixed poses and ""live action."" After agonizing on this a bit, I decided to go with two lenses, the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L USM Telephoto and the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM. Together they cover the vast range of angles and distances I need.I\'m hugely impressed by the quality of this lens. Autofocus is silent and spot on; I don\'t use manual focus much, but it\'s intuitive and easy to use. Despite it\'s size I have not found the lens to be overly heavy or cumbersome, even during all day shoots. It balances really well. Overall the lens is solidly built and delivers awesome quality results, truly outstanding. Instead of fretting about lack of IS, I picked up a quality tripod for studio shots and monopod for field work. Again, much better bang for the buck. Even handheld I haven\'t had any problems, though as a lifelong firearms enthusiast and onetime competitive shooter I may have steadier hands than most. YMMV. The f2.8 works extraordinarily well in low light, so much so that I rarely use the incredibly expensive flashes and light stands I purchased with my older, slower lenses. I cannot complement this lens enough; it\'s worth every penny and then some.By way of example, I used the EF 70-200mm f/2.8L USM to shoot the cover photo for this book:Facing Violence: Preparing for the UnexpectedIncidentally, I use B+W UV filters (Hoya has similarly excellent glass and is a bit cheaper but also more challenging to keep clean). I don\'t see any degradation of the photos due to the filter and have had outstanding results in reducing glare. Don\'t even need the lens hood most of the time, save perhaps as an extra layer of protection in case a fast moving subject smacks into it.',)"
"(""This is a big, heavy, sharp lens. Everything about this lens is high quality and built to last a very long time. The nit that I could pick with this lens is the included lens shade, that petal design is just not very good looking; and the lens shade exterior is black - it needs to be white like the rest of the lens.This lens is a massive step up from the world of amateur lenses. The constant aperture f/2.8 opens a world of photography not possible with those less expensive lenses. My Canon 7D focuses so much faster and more accurately. There are a set of auto-focus sensors that will only work with f2.8 and above lenses.I photograph college football. This lens is a decent compromise over the f2.8 300mm (Canon EF 300mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras) if you are not a working professional. Specifically, this zoom is a very sharp lens. My rate of out of focus pictures was reasonable, maybe 5% with this lens. For comparison, about 25% of my pictures are out of focus with my Tamron 70-300mm f4-5.6 zoom. Both were used during afternoon full daylight games. Move to night games and the Tamron is almost unusable.The lens barrel is large and mostly constant diameter the full length. The zoom and focus rings move very nicely, the right amount of resistance so they aren't moved accidently. The AF can be overridden by simply turning the focus ring; this is a common feature in the USM professional grade lenses. The front element does not rotate during zoom or focus. The barrel length stays constant. The switches on the side of the barrel are a design choice I'm not very fond of; they look like a strange afterthought add on to the lens. Ugly aside, the switches are solid and of incredible quality. The tripod / monopod mount is rock solid and located at almost the perfect center of gravity with a camera body attached.Image Stabilization is in two modes, I and II. The first is stabilization in both vertical and horizontal direction - in other words used for stationary subjects. The second mode stabilizes for panning; it applies stabilization in the vertical direction. Do they really add four stops of sharpness - yes probably. There's no really good way to test that claim definitively. My gut says yes. A picture I took of the moon was amazingly sharp with no tripod.The photo results are really good. This season I've compared three lenses, this zoom, the Tamron 70-300mm and the Canon 300mm f2.8. The gold standard for sharpness, speed of use, and build quality is that 300mm lens. I have never seen sharper images anywhere. The out of focus background is velvet and amazing. The biggest problem with that lens, it is super expensive and so darn heavy. The Canon 70-200mm zoom performs reasonably well compared to the fixed 300mm. It is not as absolutely sharp, but that is to be expected with a zoom versus fixed focal length. The out of focus background is nice, but not as velvety smooth as the 300mm. The Tamron just isn't even in the same universe - slower focus, nowhere near as sharp, and much smaller maximum aperture (which translates into less precise and slower focusing even with the 7D).I am in love with the 300mm f2.8. That lens is magic. This 70-200mm is an incredibly nice lens. I really like it, but I'm not in love. It is the real affordable alternative to that beast of a lens.Is this lens worth the high price? If you are going to shoot sports, absolutely yes it is worth every single penny. When I consider that a Canon IS zoom in all plastic body is around seven hundred dollars, this lens does not seem that far out of line (all steel body, weatherproofing seals, fantastic sharpness, non-rotating front element, and f2.8 maximum aperture). For the non-sports photographer, this is a much harder sell.This would make a spectacular used lens buy. These are pretty much bullet proof lenses. With the newer mark 2 version of this lens (Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras), this particular version should see a decent price benefit in the used arena. The newer model reviews are very good, but nobody is saying the mark I is now obsolete.I like this lens a lot. It is a good solid performer at all f stops. I would never attach one of the telephoto extender lenses to this lens. They are a cute idea, but totally defeat the purpose of this lens, wide maximum aperature and maximum sharpness. It would be much better to simply crop the image after the fact."",)"

"('[Note: I\'m not sure if Panasonic is stlll making this former requisite for vinyl playing, but the User\'s Manual the absence of which I complain about (below) is readily available as a download on the manufacturer\'s site, most likely testimony to the attention the machine still receives from DJs and audiophiles of all ages, countries and stripes.  Still, just as my iMac went down after a mere 2 plus years of service, my Technics Cassette Deck and Technics Receiver (both from the \'70s) had to be disposed of.  Now, only my 27"" Sylvania (made in Tennessee, and purchased in the late \'80s) and two JBL bookshelf speakers with 14"" woofers (purchased in the \'70s) continue to grow in value (in my eyes) with each passing day.]We\'ve had 2 of these machines sitting idly in a corner of the radio station until I, an unrepentant fan of vintage vinyl, decided to deploy them during a weekly jazz show.  Big mistake.  The tracking and the sound were horrendous--flagrantly worse than my personal ancient Dual turntable and new bottom-of-the-line Sony.  Then before long the lift lever proved useless.  I\'d play a track, attempt to pause it, and the lever would refuse to raise the tone arm off the record, leaving me trying to locate the tiny groove in the middle of the record--all during precious air time.  So I came in for extra practice and eventually thought I had the darn thing running at least adequately for older, lo-fi recordings.  So what happened when I announced the featured LP of the hour, ""Lena Horne at the Waldorf Astoria""?  The tone arm refused to lower itself onto the groove of the record.  Now we\'ve run up an additional 60 seconds of deadly, silent air time.I was about to throw both machines into the trash in favor of one of those current cheap consumer models in the fifty dollar range--until looking up the model on the internet.  Not only are these machines fetching upwards of a thousand but their lore is sufficient to command a lengthy entry in Wikipedia.  I mentioned my problems to my son, who had once served as a DJ at Beloit college.  Get a ""Technics SL-1200MK2"" was his immediate response.Not exactly the solution I was in search of, but at least it represented an idea, a clue, a notion--which is more than anyone else at the station appeared to possess.  I started downloading materials about this turntable--a ream\'s worth--all about the construction, the disassembly and reassembly of the delicate components of this mechanism--until I suddenly arrived at a disturbing moment of truth, one that should not be unfamiliar to many readers: life is short.Maybe these machines once did extraordinary things and, moreover, are still capable of doing them.  But it was not written in the stars that these feats would occur under my watch.  I should have been alerted when amid all of the diagrams, schematics, mechanical principles I noticed one conspicuous absence: a simple user\'s guide--like how to turn the machine on and off.  For some of us, the instructions accompanying the original piece of equipment--how to run it, or at least to start and stop it-are at the outer limit of what is comprehensible.And so ends the story of the 2 lonely turntables at the station, once again unused and unwanted but with a difference: they are now regarded with a mixture of disgust and even a modicum of respect--not unmixed with a bit of disappointment and sadness.  As for the former aspiring user, he\'s gone back to CDs and digital files, sometimes using his platters, but only if there\'s time to convert them from vinyl to digital before arriving at the station.',)"

"('As a 24-year user of Logitech mice & trackballs, with the \'occasional\' Microsoft pointing product, I can firmly state that, ""I LIKE WIRES!"". And by the same token, I vastly perfer this little wired portable mouse, to my range of small/portable Logitech wireless mice.I\'m not a fan of laptop touchpads: They just seem to be too \'close\' to operate comfortably. Not to mention they\'re subject to misfiring while you type. So I generally leave them off, and use a trackball or mouse. Logitech Trackman marbles at home, and a portable mouse on the road.I bought my \'Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse\' in late 2004.

Heck, my 10-year-old is using this mouse now with his laptop (and that represents quite a bit of abuse and slinging from table to floor to backpack).Why wires? Well, I _really_ dislike having to replace batteries. A wired mouse will always work, even at our off-grid cabin, as long as the wire can plug into your machine. In addition, when using a laptop in the recliner, I frequently like to balance the mouse on the arm of the chair - a wired mouse/trackball may slide off the arm, but it *dangles* with minimal damage. When your wireless mouse falls, it goes right to the floor!

"(""The last remaining Sony shortwave radio is the miraculous ICF-SW7600GR. It is the product ofdecades of development and expertise. Can one radio do everything you've dreamed of (especially forunder $200?) Yes, it can.My perspective includes decades of listening beginning 47 years ago in 1965. Back then, a standardshortwave radio for a casual listener was not portable. It was a five-tube desktop model that simplyexpanded upon tried and true AM radios found in every household. If you needed advanced features andhigh performance, you would need to invest in an expensive multi-tube boat anchor!Times have changed dramatically. The Sony ICFSW7600GR covers 150 kHz to 30 MHz, featuring adouble conversion design with synchronous detection, along with the 76 to 108 MHz ready for FM receptionworldwide. Gone are mechanical pushbuttons. The Sony challenges you to fill up 100 electronic presetmemories! Included is a multi-zone clock displaying local time and UTC. You can choose regular AM receptionor USB/LSB along with CW. A very useful RF gain control and a display light (for night operation) areprovided, as well. The features go on and on!My smiles began early. I was extremely impressed with its operation. The controls are quite intuitive and simpleto master. I entered one of my favorite frequencies, 14.060 MHz (the 20 meter CW QRP calling frequency) andimmediately heard a one watt station calling CQ. The telescopic whip antenna was down with just my fingerresting upon it. There was no shortage of in-the-clear shortwave broadcast stationsto listen to. How do they make a portable radio this selective and sensitive?More early trials produced more amazing results. Again, with no whip antenna extended, I pulled inseveral time reference broadcasts from America's WWV and CHU Canada. Reverting back to my childhood, Itried aeronautical VOLMET weather frequencies and logged New York, Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon,Ireland immediately with little effort. The precision of frequency direct-entry combined with theclarity of the sideband reception was almost unnerving! Plenty was heard on 30 and 40 meter CW. All Icould say was `Wow!'One transmission lives on through the decades. Radio Australia still broadcasts towards the east,covering the Pacific islands and beyond, every morning on 9580 kHz. They have ruled this frequency fordecades with a dominant signal that is hard to surpass. I took the ICF-SW7600GR to work and tried to pickthem up. Radio Australia locked in with full quieting while standing by a window. I walked into the buildingamong literally tons of electronic equipment surrounded by steel and concrete. The signal could still beheard! I know Radio Australia uses a lot of power but this is miraculous.Longwave reception was also pretty remarkable. Again, with just built-in antennas, I logged NDBs (nondirectionalbeacons) FR 407 kHz in Farmingdale, Long Island and OGY 414 kHz near Jacob Riis Park in TheRockaways in Queens. These stations are used as navigation aids and transmit very slow AM modulatedMorse Code continually. You'll never hear a station more anxious to be logged!The ICF-SW7600GR also offers synchronous detection. You can derive a full AM carrier from justone sideband. This is particularly useful if you have a very strong adjacent station or you are trying tomaneuver through digital IBOC HD Radio interference. I often get clobbered by the digital sideband of KDKA1020 Pittsburgh while trying to listen to WBZ 1030 Boston. Synchronous detection can make this noisymess into something quite listenable. It is certainly welcomed at this listening post.This is a sophisticated radio delivered in a classy manner. It is beautifully designed and quite attractive.The ICF-SW7600GR is the size and weight of a somewhat heavy paperback book. Every button and controlwas found in a logical place which could be easily memorized for in-the-dark middle-of-the-nightreception. The LCD display is big and easy to read. With 100 memories, you don't need to do a lot of directtuning. Multiple frequency comparisons are a breeze. Sony even thought of every final touch. The unit comeswith a very attractive black cloth case. Slip the radio into the case and a fold-over leaf covers it neatlysecured with a couple of pieces of Velcro.I'm sure I have only just begun to appreciate everything this radio can do. I'm still mesmerized withdirect frequency entry. There is no noticeable drift and the battery life seems endless. Sony's operationsmanual goes on for dozens of pages. Also included is the 128 page Sony Wave Handbook, a very comprehensiveall-band guide to familiarize you with the world of shortwave and beyond. A cute self-containedreel of wire, with built-in end clips, is included as a useful portable antenna. Sony included everything youneed to get started immediately. You can become a fairly sophisticated worldband listener by just openingthe box. What fun!The essence of shortwave has not changed that much since 1965. All the bands are still there. You'lleven find several new band allocations for broadcasters have come alive. Like visiting old neighborhoodsfrom your childhood, often the flavor has become something completely new. Many of the old standardbroadcasters are hard to find or gone entirely. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and eventhe BBC and Voice of America are missing in action. Many religious stations have popped up along withsome newly dominant Asian broadcasters.As a side note to this review, this receiver can also be used as a fairly accurate frequency counter.Maybe I need to get out a lot more, but nearly everything I use to pursue amateur radio has either inaccurateanalog tuning or dubious digital tuning without reliable accuracy. With a zero-beat accurate SonyICF-SW7600GR around, I can finally discover what frequency I am actually transmitting on!In a reality check, I am certainly aware that this wonderful receiver is really nothing new. Its direct ancestor,The Sony ICF-SW7600G, was first released in 1994 and has nearly every feature the current ICFSW7600GRoffers. This Sony line of compact shortwave receivers can be traced back to 1977 with the release of theoriginal ICF-7600 featuring an analog tuner. The current model employs all the lessons learned from this long legacyto produce a remarkable product. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR is a great deal of fun available for very little money.Get one and enjoy every minute."",)"
"(""I had a Philips DVD-825, an old DVD player, for a long time.  It served me well and all, but it was time to upgrade, and now that DVD prices have dropped substantially in comparison to 2 years ago, I figured I would take the initiative.For me, a DVD player has to:1 - play VCDs2 - play CD-R media (kinda goes hand-in-hand with 1)3 - connect easy4 - look good externally.That having been said, I went to Best Buy and saw this DVD player.  It was advertised for [a relatively low price], and I was skeptical at first, but I'd brought a CD-R-based VCD to test it.  Sure enough, it passed the test; passed #1, #2, and #4 so far.  Bought it, got it home, and set it up.  I had wanted to connect it through component video,[but due to a lack of funds], I wasn't going to buy that wire.  So I'd gotten an S-video Monster cable.  Hookups were easy as can be, and the menu is simple and easy.  DVDs play with unbelievable clarity, and the sound is tremendously clear, especially on 5.1.  This even plays MP3s and JPGs from a CD-R!!  So you could copy like 120 MP3 files to a CD and play them on this player, and if you have a surround system, you could run a party with this!! Amazing!!There are two negatives to this player, which are small or large, depending on how you look at it.1 - It's VERY picky about its inputs to your source (receiver, TV, etc).  My TV only has one pair of audio RCA jacks that have to be shared between the S-video and the Component Video, so I got two Y-splitters to connect both the audio from the DVD and my PS2 (which I had on the component side).  The PS2's sound came through fine, but the DVD refused to play any sound.  It would only play when directly input into the TV.  I had to use a device switcher ... to get the PS2 and the DVD both operating with S-video.2 - It's very iffy on DVD playback.  There are times (and this is fresh out of the box) when you press play and it will sit at a black screen.  You can't stop it, you can't do anything.  You have to power it off manually using the switch in the back.  Also, there are times when you'll press a button on the remote and the DVD will respond late.  For example, I could press Play, and it won't actually start playing until like a minute later; almost as though it were processing something.  It doesn't happen often enough to be a big problem, but it is sort of a nuisance.  This might be just my ignorance about the product.Besides these two things, this is a great product for the money.  Buy this if you need a DVD player or you need to upgrade."",)"
"('I have been happy with my three older zip drives, and this drive is continuing my unbroken string of satisfaction with Iomega products.Installation: The software installed cleanly.  I love boring installations!Connectivity: The drive ran fine on a hub.  It helps that it is self-powered and doesn\'t need to draw power off the USB line.  It comes with an adapter-at least my drive did.  (The ""Technical Data"" section of this site\'s product description says that the drive is powered by your USB cable.  But if you choose to use the adapter, I doubt that that statement is correct.)  I later installed a USB 2.0 card and gave the zip drive its own port, but it is still plugged into the adapter.Speed: Speed is relative.  Even with the obsolete USB 1, the 750 was faster than my 4x CD-RW, my previous backup engine.  And now with USB 2.0, it writes a 175 MB zip file in 45 seconds.Human Factors: Another reviewer complained that this drive is so lightweight that it just scoots backwards when you try to insert a disk.  He\'s right.  So I took a crude but effective approach to ""planting"" the drive.  I took a big piece of duct tape and taped the drive to the top of my system unit.  Now the drive is in a real handy spot, and it doesn\'t budge when I insert a disk. So what if it\'s no longer portable, and it\'s more like an internal drive. That\'s OK.Vulnerable to static discharge?  It is, according to one reviewer, who had a spark leap from his finger to the drive, and said spark temporarily knocked his drive out of commission.  I have had no such problem because with the drive taped in place, I don\'t have to hold it down with one hand when inserting a disk.  So I don\'t need to touch the case.  Also, it may help that the drive is against my system unit\'s metal case.Some nitpicking:(1) This drive is much noisier than my previous three zip drives (all internal). Its ""zip"" noises are loud and raspy.(2) Dust might get inside the drive because there is more air space around the door than I have ever seen on a drive. I hope it won\'t collect enough dust to damage it. I see no way to safely clean it out.(3) Iomega innovates so quickly that any Iomega product you buy may soon be obsolete.SAVE THE ANTI-STATIC BAG that the drive ships in.  If you ever need to carry the drive somewhere, you can use the bag to protect it from static and keep that loose penny in your purse or briefcase from slipping into it.January, 2007 update: I ended up buying two of these drives.  However, the first drive has now died after about three years of normal use with no spill, fall, or other accident.  My concern about dust (#2 under nitpicking, above) might be more than a nit, after all.',)"

"(""This is an awesome digital picture-taking machine, which heralds the imminent death of 35 mm film.  The D-100 does pretty much everything that a high-end film SLR does, and it does it beautifully.  A 512MB CF card will enable the D100 to take hundreds of high-quality pictures that are indistinguishable in quality from those taken with film.  The Six-megapixel images in Large/Fine or RAW mode are quite competitive with their film counterparts for almost all purposes.  The advantage of digital, of course, is that the consumer, equipped with pretty much any computer, can process and print the pictures him or her self with far more power and flexibility than one had in a darkroom processing film.  The digital darkroom has arrived.The D100 can use Nikon's entire line of autofocus lenses and many of the older manual focus lenses, allowing the photographer to easily migrate from film to digital.  The camera has spot, matrix, and center-weighted exposure options, a programmed mode, apature priority or speed priority, as well as all of the manual options.  Autofocus is crisp, fast, and works very well in low light.  This camera is nearly as powerful in terms of its focusing and exposure options as the Nikon F5, which is the film camera I used for years before replacing my F5 with the D100.Perhaps the greatest testimonial for the D100 is that it is notorious that the vast majority of photographers who I know who have bought a D100 never (or at least rarely) shoot film ever again.The D100 takes OK shots right out of the camera, but to get best results most photographers will want to &quot;process&quot; the pictures through either Nikon's own program &quot;Capture 3&quot; or an aftermarket program like Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.  I and probably most others have found that some of the post-processing settings on these programs really improve the images produced by the D100.  This is a deliberate design &quot;feature&quot; of the D100 in that the D100 anticipates that serious photographers wish to retain a certain amount of control over their images.  Accordingly, rather than making all of the decisions for you, the D100 produces images for which final exposure and contrast decisions can and should be made in a post-processing program such as Adobe Photoshop Elements or Capture 3.  That having been said, the D100 can and does produce fine images without using a post-processing program.  But almost all users have probably found that the best results are achieved by using such a program.  In my opinion this is true of pretty much all of the high-end digital cameras out there, and is not confined to the D100.  This is the power of digital photography--the photographer, at little cost (a low-end PC and $100-200 program are all that are required) can have a powerful &quot;digital darkroom&quot; which yields tremendous control over how the images turn out.Physically, the D100 is ruggedly built.  The rear LCD is bright and clear.  The menu systems on the D100 are very well designed and quite intuitive--after familiarizing myself with the manual for several hours, I now find that I do not need to refer to the manual at all even for very complex &quot;custom&quot; situations.  The menus are not overly &quot;layered&quot; as is the case with some digital cameras.  The on-board flash is fine for snapshot portraits and the like, but most serious users will want to spring for either the SB-50DX or the SB-80DX flash, both of which are more or less designed for the D100.Negatives on the camera are few.  I mentioned above the post-processing issue, which in my mind is not a negative, but instead is just Nikon giving the photographer as much power and flexibility as possible.  The matrix metering is not as powerful on the D100 as on the top-of-the-line F5, inasmuch as in tricky lighting situations the D100s center-weighted or spot metering will sometimes yield better results.  Having said that, after several hours of experimenting I can now confidently take consistently good pictures with the D100 in fill-flash conditions.  In common with the exposure issues, the D100 more or less requires photographers who want very &quot;sharp&quot; images to apply &quot;sharpness&quot; post-processing.  Most of us have probably found that this produces better results than setting the sharpening in-camera, for reasons that exceed the scope of this review.By the way, the battery life in the D100 is phenomenal.  The on-board proprietary Nikon battery lets you take many hundreds of pictures, and serious shooters can buy at modest cost the MD-100 accessory which lets you shoot with either 2 Nikon batteries or a bunch of AAs.  Either way this allows you to literally shoot all weekend likely without needing to recharge.  The Nikon batteries recharge in a bit over an hour.For good reason the D100, retailing now (October 2003) below $1,500, has put powerful digital photography in the hands of serious amateurs.  It is a well-designed and sturdy camera that is a delight to own and use."",)"

"('I am a long-time user of highly responsive film SLRs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias. I have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move. What I really want is a $1,500 digital SLR with a full frame sensor that will take my Nikon lenses. I figure that is at least three years off, and I am getting impatient. Hence I decided to spring for a ""point-and-shoot"" digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations. I chose the G3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images.The two limitations I knew I would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash. As of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film SLR. At least once you\'ve got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the G3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what I\'ve read, is better than just about anything else available. What makes the focus-lock lag time something I can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8. Once I get focus lock, I can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus.Now what about the flash problem? Relative to what I can easily achieve with external flash on my Nikon SLR, the internal flash on the G3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots. Fortunately, the G3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, I already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the Metz 60 CT-4. I can\'t use my Nikon external flash on a Canon camera, but I CAN use my Metz, with the proper Metz module and extension cord connected between the G3 and the 60 CT-4. For those who have this Metz flash (or the 45CL-3) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this G3, the Metz module you need is the SCA 3102 and the connector cord is the SCA 3000C.In order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself. Contrary to what I\'ve read elsewhere, the G3 DOES sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from Canon. You also have to set the G3 to second shutter sync, which is what you\'d want to do most of the time anyhow. Then just forget about all the controls you have on the Metz flash head itself and the SCA 3102 control panel, because they are all IGNORED. The G3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the Metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isn\'t, it\'s because you\'ve exceeded the range of the Metz flash itself. This might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you ARE bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away. Unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the Metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem can\'t easily be solved. The second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the Metz (with the attendant shadows unfortunately). But once you\'ve got your exposure within an acceptable range, the G3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that I can hardly get with my Nikon F100 film camera. The 60 CT-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you. The results are shadow-free images that look as if they\'ve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.Now there is one more complaint I have about the G3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (I only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing I did was replace the 32 MByte CF with a 512 MByte CF, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!). The Canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image AT ALL, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera. I believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information. Maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, you\'d see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces. I didn\'t wait to experiment. Instead, I bought the Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in. What this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw G3 hardware. Without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as I\'ve ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image! The Adobe Camera Raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software. What the G3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical. What the Photoshop plug-in gives you is REALITY, and then if you want fantasy, you can use Photoshop to create it. But at least you\'re starting with the most photorealistic images I\'ve ever seen from a camera. I am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images I am getting from this G3 (in conjunction with my professional flash system), and can easily put up with the camera\'s limitations, because I\'ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits.',)"

"('5 Ports is needed many times if it is Net gear always makes great products They know what they are doing dont sweat when u see this brand',)"
"(""I purchased both the 8 port and 5 port version of this. It arrived quickly and in an extremely sturdy box for something made in China. Both units worked right out of the box. No fooling with router settings, so refreshing!Remember one port will be your supply port that is typically connected to a router. So, if you have 5 Ethernet items to connect, DON'T buy the 5 port version, get the 8 port version and have a few ports available for future.Nice heavy weight feel and made with a STEEL CASE! Yep, not some crappy plastic like everything else but steel. Rubber feet on the bottom and even with Several Ethernet cables connected it sits flat and doesn't want to flip over (like my plastic case router). Runs cool with ventilation openings on the side.I'm resisting the urge to look inside as my background is in Electronics, I wonder if it's as nice inside as outside.The only 'minor gripe' is that it has a wall wart power supply and while it's slim and everything I sure wish we would get back to the old days of when the power supply was inside the case and all you had was a AC power cord with a skinny plug. I think those days are gone. HOWEVER I just found anSocket Sense SS1650W-06 6-Outlet Expandable Surge Protector, 6 ftat Amazon.The twinkling data lights are a bit annoying. Kinda like a blinking Christmas Tree, so I turn it to the side so I don't notice them. Would be nice if they could be turned off as they serve (ME) no purpose. I don't need the lights.Power plug in in the long back side along with some kind of anti-theft-carry-off opening and the ports are on the other long side.I ran out of ports on my router so I sprang for these.  A long Ethernet run of 90 foot cable snakes downstairs and now I have ports on the entertainment center.As a side note, Amazon sells several 'FLAT' Ethernet cables in various length and I'm switching to those because they can easily be pushed under the wall molding and also thin enough to have a door or window closed on it. So for I have no problems with the cable.As said, I'm extremely pleased with this switch (I keep wanting to call it a hub).Update: Sept 2013, 6 Months later and ZERO problems. There is no software, no updating, no fan etc, etc in the 5 and 8 port version I have. Note These other comments by reviewers include all models listed on the page with the 5 & 8 ports. Don't get confused.  This runs cool and is in a nice metal enclosure. I'm an Electronics Tech and I'm always sooooo very happy to see metal enclosers that reduce the amount of RFI floating around my shack.  If you don't get both lights to come on when you plug in the Ethernet cable on a Gigabit system, something is wrong and it's defaulted back to 100 Gb and it may well be a bad cable or corroded port/plug. Try cleaning or just plug-unplug several times and get a super cheap Ethernet cable tester from Amazon. Everything I have is 1 Gb and I use Cat6 colored cable so I don't mix them up with older cables.  So, the wrong cable will work but at reduced speeds.I'm still impressed with this and it's been running 24/7 for 6 Months and also had a few power outages because of stormes and I'm still having ZERO problems..."",)"

"(""Punch AS 18 is very stable, especially for the wide set of features and capabilities it provides. It has never crashed for me using Windows XP. This indicates a very professional development team rather than a collection of disparate packages cobbled together in one box.I liked its ease of use a lot. After a few hours of modifying some samples and then doing a few simple plans from scratch, I feel very capable of using all the features I need. A few years ago I tried HomeDesigner. It was painfully difficult to use and it had only a small subset of Punch 18's features. I finally I gave up using it. Every 3D CAD program has unique ways to place and draw objects, rotate, pan, zoom, scale, view, and navigate and so on in the 3D universe. Punch is definitely one of the easiest I've used.3D LiveView is immensely helpful in showing a perspective view of the 2D plan you are working. You can navigate in two ways. WalkThrough is generally better for viewing inside the house and FlyAround better for outside.WalkThrough is at a constant (but adjustable) height where you move forward or backwards and can rotate (pan) to any angle. It's like walking through the design at eyeball level. The camera is always in a horizontal direction. Unfortunately this does not allow you to look up at the ceiling. But you can select a wide angle that shows some of the ceiling.FlyAround is like a view from a helicopter. You orbit a fixed point at variable altitudes and distances from the center point. FlyAround always aims exactly at the center of the orbit. It's shown on the 2D plan and can easily be moved. You are always looking downward from the helicopter. Unfortunately, you cannot look vertically down because the max downward angle seems to be only 30 degrees below horizontal, an unnecessary restriction.LiveView has 2 ways to render the picture. I especially like ClearView, which is a 3D B&W; drawing that allows the transparency of walls and other objects to range from almost clear to fully opaque. Sometimes it's very handy to see what's on the other side of a wall of the room you're working in. ClearView rendering speed is very fast. ColorView is a little slower, with 4 quality (detail) settings and 3 shadow settings (off, low and high).LiveView is displayed its own window, which makes it easy to move and resize the 3D view as you work with the 2D plan. This feature is certainly more flexible and much more practical than forcing it into one of 4 corners, or such similar limitations, that some other 3D CADs impose... Every feature they claim they have, they actually do provide, and in a consistent and integrated user interface that all work well together.There are a few minor glitches. The limitations of view angles mentioned above should be relaxed. WalkThrough is tricky in that it is too easy to move forward/backward when you only want to pan (rotate). It's too easy to accidentally pop through a wall when you only want to look around the room. This could easily fixed with a shift key or such that would lock one movement direction and allow the other.2D zoom and pan is inconvenient in that you must use the mouse (no keyboard commands for zoom) and it seems to get out of control -- often way too fast. Visio's zoom is the easiest I've ever encountered: Ctl-Shift keys plus mouse buttons do all pans and zooms instantly and easily, with fine control (every 2D CAD should use it!). Similarly, more of the toolbar selections should have keyboard commands.There are 20 provided floor plans that go from simple to complex designs. These are excellent to play around with and learn what's possible. But none of them have textures or objects! The walls, floors, roofs, landscapes, are bare, no furniture, fixtures or plumbing, totally devoid of human habitation. What a lost opportunity to exhibit many of Punch's really great features.The most serious deficiency is getting wall to properly intersect with the roof. Punch provides 6 roof types, plus some very useful free-hand roof designing tools. It is incredibly easy to add roofs to complex floor plans. But you are compelled to MANUALLY calculate the heights of all points on each wall where it intersects the roof (by using trig, or a drawing on a paper grid).While it is hard to describe this problem in words, I'll try a simple example. You have a large main area and a smaller attached room to the side. What does the roof look like for this L-shaped plan? One roof cannot cover the whole thing. With Punch it is *easy* to select and place a suitable roof design over the two areas. Here's the problem: the common wall of the large area attached the small area will extend up to the two roofs. The wall has a complex shape.Fortunately, Punch has this shape among its wall selections. But YOU must specify the elevations and lengths of the oddly shaped wall. If you make them too large, the wall sticks up above the roof. Too small and there is a gap under the roof. Big birds can fly through it. Some of the sample plans show this problem (P018). Ironically, LiveView must perform these calculations in order to render a 3D view. Punch desperately needs the command: Extent Walls Vertically to Roof.All in all, Punch-bang AS 18 is a fine piece of software, lots of features, easy to use and with minor nits."",)"

"('CD-Rs are a much needed thing for me. Even if I still have my music on an iPod, I still have a lot of documents in my computer. I definitely have a big enough hard drive to store all of my weird documents and online-schooling and such. But sometimes I have to go to the library or use a different computer or so on. I prefer using CD-Rs rather than a jumpdrive because they are easy to forget and don\'t store a very large amount--which I believe it should for the price you are paying for those things. CD-Rs are less costly and I don\'t need many, just a few that basically ""just work"". And these Sony CD-Rs do just that!Whenever I\'m shopping for CD-Rs I look to see what is most inexpensive from a reliable brand. I have had most luck from CD-Rs from Sony, Maxell, and Philips--all three which are decent manufacturers. TDK\'s never seem to burn at the speed they advertise. Imation\'s just seem to be coasters. And on Memorex CD-Rs the paint always seem to chip off just months after use. So I try searching for those three brands. And almost everytime Sony\'s are always on sale way below the list price. I don\'t really need jewel cases either since I have no desire to keep my old documents--at least those that date back months ago. And jewel cases seem to be much more inexpensive when I don\'t buy them with the CD-Rs. I suppose companies add them to your CD-Rs so you find them a ""value"".Using Sony CD-Rs are easy. I just do like I do with any CD-R, burn my files through Nero. I won\'t say these are completely burn free, but even the great Maxell has a couple mess-ups every once in awhile. But whether I\'m burning music (for whatever reason since I now have an iPod) or burning important documents, these CD-Rs are very trusty with very little burn errors. Maxell is slightly more reliable than these, but for the price I can\'t see how you can go wrong.These CD-Rs also seem to last fairly long for me. I have a couple discs dating back to early 2004 that are seeing some minor scratch on the top of the disc, but it\'s certainly nothing unusable. Some discs dating back then are actually in pretty good condition compared to my TDK and Imaton discs. Some reviewers complain about data-loss after a year or so after burning, but I have yet to notice this. All of my CD-Rs from Sony seem to play fine in any CD player I use and my computer whatever the age of the disc. The bottom of the disc doesn\'t scratch as easily as other brands but collects fingerprints fairly well, which is again why I like using jewel cases. Also, the CD-Rs are very clean-cut, meaning they have lots of room to write on.Overall, these Sony CD-Rs work just fine for me. They don\'t show many burn errors and last a good long time, plus have the Sony name. They aren\'t quite as good as Maxell CD-Rs, but get the job done at a cheaper price. In general, a good ""gets the job done without spending tons"" CD-R. 4 stars.',)"
"(""There is nothing spectacular about this drive, but nothing particularly bad either.  The software they provide does not work correctly with Windows XP, but aside from that it's a good drive to get if you need to upgrade your existing system.Speed - It's not going to set any records, but it's not slow either.  It seems to fall in the middle of the pack for performance benchmarks according to the various websites that have evaluated this product.Noise - Again, it's not the quietest drive on the market.  In fact I've seen other models of Maxtor drives that were practically noise-free.  This one you can hear slight chattering as it accesses the data, but I can barely hear it above the noise of the various cooling fans in my PC.  In short, you would need to have supersonic hearing to be upset by the noise this one makes, but there are quieter drives out there.Heat - Once again, it's in the middle of the road.  Most of the drives out today are generating a lot more heat than the older drives.  The reputable hardware testing sites I've checked put this in the middle of the pack.  If you have a standard computer case and multiple hard drives, most likely there is very little space between them.  I would recommend getting a quality ball bearing cooling fan for this and any drive if you want to extend its life, but if you're installing it in a cramped space with little airflow, then a cooling fan is a necessity due to the heat it generates.Quite frankly, most of today's drives are quick enough and quiet enough that, with the exception of a few performance models, it's hard to tell any difference between them unless you're a serious computer gearhead.  The only areas left to compete are in reliability, customer service, and software.  I haven't had to deal with their customer service, and obviously I can't rate the reliability of this new purchase, but I can comment on the software.The drive comes with Maxtor's MaxBlast hard drive cloning and utility software.  This is the one area that they could've beat the competition and given me a reason to bump it up to four stars.  Unfortunately, this software proved to be so much a disappointment that I'd recommend you do not use it. (In fact, it's so bad I should probably should bump this down to two stars.)Right off the bat I knew I was in trouble as I have a separate Promise UDMA controller built into my ASUS A7V motherboard.  MaxBlast couldn't detect it and simply crashed every time I tried booting it in DOS mode.  DOS mode is the preferred and generally less error prone method of cloning an existing hard drive, but since I couldn't get it to work that way I attempted cloning my drive running MaxBlast from Windows XP.  First off, it took over two hours to copy a 40GB drive over to this one (why?)  Secondly, MaxBlast gives you options to set your partitions when you're formatting from scratch, but it didn't give me any options to set my partitions when I cloned my existing drive.  It forces you to accept one partition that's the same size as your old drive, then creates a second partition for the remaining space.  Not what I wanted.  Finally, I would've accepted the previous two annoyances if it would've copied XP correctly.  It did copy XP and I can boot up, but since the transfer I have run into all kinds of problems with Explorer crashing frequently, the system restore function no longer working, and other annoyances.  Add that I've had to reregister some of my existing programs and it's apparent this is definitely not a clone of my old drive.So there you go.  Like the review title says, it's your basic hard drive with about the same specs as other drives out there.  If the price is right and you just need extra storage space, it's worth buying.  However, if you need to transfer data from an existing drive, plan on paying extra for some cloning software that actually works.Hope the review helped."",)"
"('They are very good headphones for the price! Not much to say bad about them.  If I do have something I will update the review.',)"
"('I bought both of these headphones at the same time, not sure of what I wanted. I like bass response but also audio clarity. My review is based off of sound and comfort. I\'ll start with comfort because that\'s easiest.Comfort:Even the best sounding headphones absolutely suck if they hurt after only 30 minutes of listening. This is the case I found with the M30s vs. the XB500s. After wearing the M30s for about 45 minutes, my ears began to get irritated. I cannot say the same for the XB500s. It\'s like the XB500s have two pillows resting against your ears. Comfort for the XB500s scores 5/5...the M30s get a 3/5. I feel like I could sleep in the XB500s. They are perhaps the best headphones I\'ve experienced from a comfort standpoint.Sound:Sound quality is why we buy headphones. In my opinion, the quality of the M30s far surpassed the XB500s.In fact, the XB500s are already packed up and ready to be shipped back to Amazon (thank you for the awesome return policy and service Amazon). Don\'t stop reading now. The only reason the XB500s are going back is because bass isn\'t my fancy. Here are three different songs I listened to in testing the cans:T.I. - Whatever You Like:XB500 - Impressive. If you are a bass junkie, these are awesome cans.  I like this song but it doesn\'t have a lot of audio components to it. I selected it because it\'s bass heavy. The XB500s definitely won hands down with this track.M30 - Bass response was not bad by any means. The Sony\'s crushed them but they performed pretty well but didn\'t even come close to hanging with the Sony\'s. Again, the bass notes hit well but these headphones are made for an ""all around sound"". They got dominated it the bass arena.Adele - Set Fire to the Rain:XB500 - This song tells a completely different story.""Set Fire to the Rain"" has a decent bass line but the XB500s took it way to far. It was so much so that it was distracting to the lyrics. Mids and highs were completely drown out by the bass.M30 - Seems like a perfect harmony of highs and lows for these headphones. The bass notes hit but not to heavy. Near the end of the song, I noticed notes and chords that I have not noticed before.Call of Duty - Modern Warefare 3:XB500 - I played this with a colleague of mine the day I got both headphones. The XB500s were awesome when firing the light machine gun. It somewhat felt like I had the actual gun in my hand because my head was literally felling every shot from the sound. The ambient sound was ok. Nothing was pronounced.M30 - I must say I tip my hat to the XB500s in this example. I appreciated the response when firing the light machine gun but it was nowhere near the Sony\'s. The highlight with these was the clarity. I could easily pick up on the location of enemies (right, left, front, and back) of enemies based from the sounds. While I loved firing the light machine gun with the Sony\'s, the clarity of the M30s gave me a better advantage.Bottom line:The M30s win this battle because they are an excellent value. The XB500s will be returned, however, they are extremely comfortable and a great headphone but the bass was too overpowering.  I will most likely return the M30s as well because of comfort even though they sound great. I\'m listening to music while writing this review and they are already hurting my ear. Sound quality of the M30s is great...comfort, not so much (for me that is).I will be getting a set of V-Moda M-80s headphones (not the same price range I know). I haven\'t purchased them yet so look for my review over there shortly.',)"
"('While I am not an audiophile nor a studio engineer or recording musician, I can tell the difference when bass is too strong or the high-end is screeching too much. These ATH-M30 headphones provide great clarity and are perfect for my needs.I haven\'t used headphones in many years, relying primarily on ear buds because they were ""more convenient"" when I needed them. However, I had never found ear buds that I was truly happy with. The closest has been thePhilips ActionFit SHQ1000/28 In-Ear Headphones Tuned for Sportswhich provide pretty good quality sound for what they are but they are still inside my ear. Thus my quest began to find headphones that did not cost a fortune, produce good sound, and are comfortable for long periods of time. I read a lot of reviews and queried my friends. I ended up with these AudiTechnica cans and have not looked back.The sound quality is very good. They are certainly not as good as the Bose headphones my friend owns but they are (at the price I paid) a fraction of the cost and he needs the quality that Bose delivers. I simply need something that sounds good, providing a good balance between bass, and the mid- and high-range, does not distort the sound if I want to crank it up a bit, and is comfortable. These do fit that bill. I must say that I hardly feel that I am wearing these due to their light weight and the nearly perfect fit over my ears. In addition the noise cancelling works very well.My primary uses are with my: Lenovo G570 laptop when traveling or away from home;Kindle Fire HD 7"", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 16 GBwhen traveling; and,Lenovo IdeaCentre K410 Desktopwhile at home working or editing photos. I do on occasion use these with my TV. I have a few hundred of my favorite tunes loaded on my computers and Kindle and the music covers every genre performed.The cans work extremely well with my TV, laptop and pc, not as well with my Kindle, but passable. And really the only time I use them with my Kindle is during a flight. The sound (and noise cancelling) work well while in the air. While they do not fold up like some others do they easily fit in my backpack and I simply keep the cord wound and secured.I appreciate that there is only one cord going into the phones on one side and the fact that they are thick. These were a couple of other key points that assisted my final purchase decision. There were many reviews about headphones where the cords were thin and the owners ended up trashing them due to damage.Would I have paid the $100+ MSRP? I doubt it. Though I am not sure what I would have ended up with were these not priced below $50. Glad I don\'t have to worry about that.Thus, to sum it up, I definitely recommend these for anyone who wants a quality made comfortable product but who does not want to spend a small fortune on cans that will provide, in most cases, a good consistent sound quality across the boards, i.e., for any genre of music. Giving them 4 stars because I have heard my friend\'s Bose which are definitely 5 star.',)"
"('Just an amazing lens. Works awesome on my 70D . The AF motor is loud so be prepared for it.',)"
"('',)"
"('I needed a fast lens to take pictures of my son\'s hockey games.  Hockey rinks are probably the hardest place to take great pictures.  The lighting is usually poor, the surface bright (forcing a manual overexposure thereby giving up some shutter speed), and the action is very fast.  Also, focusing through a puck-scuffed glass panel is another challenge in itself.I recently purchased a Canon Rebel XS with the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens kit.  The pictures from the first hockey game were not very good.  The rink was one of the best in terms of overhead lighting intensity.  I set the ISO to 1600, zoomed the lens to max (55mm), set the focus to servo mode (continuous focus of moving objects), set the camera to aperture priority, and set aperture to the fastest setting for 55mm (f/5.6).  Since hockey rinks (surface and boards) are white, I had to set the exposure compensation to +2/3 so my son\'s image would not turn out too dark.  Since 55mm is not a large zoom range, I stood next to the glass near the other team\'s goalie (my son\'s a forward).  Unfortunately the shutter speed for all the pictures was between 1/50 and 1/80; way too slow to capture a fast moving sport. The only pictures that looked acceptable were face-offs and when my son was parked in front of the net.I purchased this 50mm 1.8 lens and used it this weekend for a hockey tournament.  The rink was at the other extreme in lighting; i.e., one of the worse lit.  For the 1PM game there was a bit of sun light coming in from a few small windows, so I set the ISO to 800.  I again set the exposure compensation to +2/3.  I used shutter priority this time and set the speed to 1/125.  That was fast enough to freeze the body motion and allowed for a nice blur effect of the hockey stick and puck when my son took a shot.  The aperture bounced between f/1.8 and f/2.8; the higher f-stops gave me a little deeper depth of field that helped put my son and the goalie in better focus.  The lens had no trouble with servo focus mode (continuous focusing of a moving object).  The biggest issues with focus was the marks on the glass and the other players skating in front of my son when I had the focus locked on him. In spite of that, the pictures turned out very nice; exceeding my expectations. The lack of image stabilization didn\'t seem to matter.  The fact that I captured a nice shot of my son scoring the first goal of the tournament (cool shot where my son and the goalie were in focus and you can see the puck under the goalie heading for the net) already justified the $100 purchase.  When I came back for the evening game, there was obviously no sun light boost from the windows, so I had to bump the ISO up to 1600.  Again, I captured many nice shots.I can\'t wait for a game at one of the better lit rinks.  I plan on using shutter priority and setting the speed to 1/250 or 1/500.This lens is definitely staying on the camera. I took identical pictures comparing the lens kit and this lens, and I can see the difference in clarity.  I did notice a slight darking of the corners at f/1.8 when I took a picture of the sky; however, if I wasn\'t looking for it, I probably would not have noticed it.This lens is a must have for parents with kids who play indoor sports (e.g., hockey, basketball, karate, wrestling, gymnastics, ballet, etc).BTW - The f/1.8 lens may be the sweet spot for lens speed.  There is a good (but highly technical) discussion in the DP-Review Open Talk forum titled ""Light loss on current sensors at big Fstops, part II"" regarding light loss on high speed lens.  Basically, fast lens (f/1.2 - f/1.4) pass light to the digital sensor at a very sharp angle and, as a result, there is signal loss of about 1/2 stop.  That makes an f/1.4 the equivalent to an f/1.8 lens.  The dSLR camera bodies (all manufacturers) detect the high-speed lens and compensate by ""electronically"" increasing the sensor signal gain.  That kind of defeats the purpose of spending the extra (and large) sum of money for a fast lens.',)"
"('I got my fixed Nifty 50-1.8 lens yesterday for my Canon T3, and it does everything those 2500 reviewers raved about. And I think it\'s probably still a good deal, even though it\'s popularity has pushed it\'s March 2013 price up to $114 plus  another $10-$20 for a protective UV filter, which I suggest. And yes, I\'m going to get one of those inexpensive rubber lens hoods everyone suggests to cut down on flare, which also doubles as a bumper guard. BUT I\'d like to point out something you may not have heard before, so you don\'t rush to get one like you can\'t live or shoot another picture without one. As a grandparent, I now shoot my grandkids, mostly inside a small 1100 sq. ft. house, mostly inside an 11\' x 16\' living room, with even less move-around space once you add furniture. My point is, although I got some great portrait shots yesterday of my little grandaugher, the fixed 50mm length was almost ""too close"" for me to navigate and frame the shots the way I would have preferred. I ended up with some very artsy, very close head shots with a beautifully blurred background. However, once I had those in the bank, I found myself yearning for my standard 18-55mm zoom lens that came with the kit. Canon knew what they were doing when they picked this lens for everyday use as it really does give you the flexibility to find just the right focal length without moving position for the everyday pics you want to take around the house. (You need those wide angle options in a small room.) And my amateur eye found the quality of the pics to be just as good as those I took with the 50mm, though I\'m sure many experts would argue that point with me, claiming the 50mm was much sharper. Perhaps. In conclusion, for my life, this very nice 50mm lens with it\'s fast 1.8mm lens will be reserved for close-up indoor portraits where I want to blur the background. And as soon as Spring emerges, I think this fast 1.8 lens will be much more useful as an outdoor lens for flowers, stop action sports shots, fading daylight shots, and candids that get you discreetly closer to your subject\'s face without being in their face for natural, unsuspecting shots.',)"

"('I own the Canon 60D with 15-85 and 70-300 L lens and also the Pentax k-x with numerous prime lenses. I spent a trip to Niagara Falls bringing this 50mm lens for its low-light capability and bokeh. After playing around with it I must say that I would not recommend it for those who are picky with their pictures. Only if you are on a very tight budget and just getting your feet wet with DSLR\'s, then it is a prime choice. No pun intended.First of all lets talk about its good qualities. Its cheap and very light. You dont notice the weight on the camera at all which makes it easier for walking around without getting tired. Thats a good thing because with this prime lens, your feet does the zooming. Speaking of which, the 50mm focal length (on a APS-C sensor) is just a tad beyond normal viewing angle. Meaning, if you loop your fingers into a circle and put it over your eye, then thats the image you get with this lens. This focal length is good for waist-high portraits without moving back too far. Because of the wide aperture of 1.8, this means its good for parties and indoor get togethers where one could take candid shots. I wouldn\'t recommend it for group shots, the image circle is a bit too tight. The best sharpness comes around f/4 to f/5.6, which is superb in resolution, and it is great starting at f/2.4. Couple this with minimal chromatic aberation and pictures can really pop at you against a blurry background. The build quality is ok, its plastic yes, but just be careful with it. Your money is going into the optical design. If you really want to have fun with this lens then I suggest a google search for ""bokeh hearts"". You will get endless questions from your friends!Ahhh but no lens is perfect and this is clearly one of them. For those who know bokeh (Japanese for blurry), this lens might disappoint you. Surely its capable of creating it easily with its wide aperture, but its very ""nervous"" looking both in front and back out of focus planes, far from buttery smooth. Highlights are nice and round at f/1.8, but quickly turn into pentagons with anything above that. Couple this with the observation that contrast and color are dull at the widest aperture. then your best images are not going to be at its acclaimed low-light capability. How much so? Well, it steadily gets better to f/4, and thats the aperture that I would call excellent for this lens. Shots against the sun will get you prone to flare and washed out images, especially if you have a Tiffen UV filter, which most people get with this lens.So there you have it. This lens has its pros and cons, but its a good value for starters. It would be my recommendation as the first prime lens to get to see if you like the use of primes. If you have any L lenses, then you probably already know that the 50mm 1.4 and 1.2 are increasingly better. Oh, if you find 50mm focal length too zoomed in then the 35mm f/2 is similar and a little wider. Hope this helps!',)"
"('The best lens for this price... in really love this lens, the pictures taken with this lens are awesome, is the lens you need to buy after the kit lens of your camera',)"
"('The 50mm/f1.4 and 50mm/f1.8 are the BEST PORTRAIT LENSES that Canon offers.  I own a Canon Rebel 2000 and Digital Rebel XT and have used both these lenses for several months.  Pictures have been outstanding and my professional customers frequently cite the sharpness, light balance, depth of field, color reproduction, and ""bokeh"" (intentional blurring of background in portraits) from these lenses.  Some people question the usefulness of a 50mm lens on digital SLRs with a 1.6x crop factor (i.e., 50mm lens = 80mm on a dSLR like the Digital Rebel XT)... I can vouch that the range is beautiful and relevant, focusing more closely on key subjects in portraits.WHAT DO THESE LENSES HAVE IN COMMON?  They are both fast (the f1.4 is blazing fast - dSLR can hardly keep up!), details are incredibly sharp (you can see individual hair strands), virtually no chromatic (color) aberration, no dithering or shadows in the corners, focusing is rapid and quiet (thanks to Canon\'s patented Ultrasonic USM technology) and photo quality parallels even my professional Canon ""L"" lenses.  These fixed aperture lenses also provide superior pictures than telephoto lenses at 50mm because of better glass and aspherical elements.HOW ARE THESE LENSES DIFFERENT?  Having tested both lenses across 1500+ pictures, there are 5 key factors that make the f1.4 superior (justifying the $300+ price tag).1) FASTER ESPECIALLY IN LOW LIGHT: Extra f-stop makes the f/1.4 better for indoor photos or low light.  Great companion to the 480EX flash.  I was able to take nearly 40 pics/min with flash and the fastest Sandisk 1GB Ultra II CF card2) NO CHROMATIC ABERRATION, whereas the f/1.8 has slight yellowing of photos under certain lighting conditions or where edge definition is low3) FULL AUTO/MANUAL FOCUSING RANGE: f/1.8 requires flipping between auto and manual using a switch, while f/1.4 can be manually ""hot"" focused/tweaked after auto focusing4) SUPERIOR BUILD QUALITY:  The f/1.8 is plastic and feels cheap, like it might fall apart anytime.  The f/1.4 is metal, weighty, and is for the proud lens owner5) CLEANER ""BOKEH"" - f/1.4 produces beautiful blurring of background in portraits (""bokeh"") while the f/1.8 leaves less clean edges.  Canon reviews suggest this is due to the f/1.4 having 8 lens elements vs. 5 elements for the f/1.8WHICH LENS SHOULD YOU BUY?  This is a question of utility vs. value.  The f/1.4 costs over $300 while the f/1.8 can be acquired for under $75.  The f/1.4 will last forever while the f/1.8 will probably break under normal use in a year.  Does this justify the 4x price tag?  If you are a budding photographer looking for a ""play lens"" then the f/1.8 will more than over-deliver.  If you are a photo enthusiast who looks for ""the perfect shot,"" you will want the f/1.4 because it surpasses every expectation (and so you\'re not left wondering, ""what if"").  If you are a photo professional, you already have the f/1.4 lens among your bag and are not reading this review. :-)',)"

"('I don\'t understand what all the complaining is about - I\'ve had these headphones for about a week now, and they actually work fairly well, and do pretty much what they\'re supposed to do.I originally bought these to use at work - I work in a large cubicle farm, and as we all know, there\'s virtually no getting anything done when people feel the need to stand in your cubicle and talk to eight other people across the room (or the constant speakerphone user in the next cube).  They block human speech VERY well, and I am extremely pleased with how they work.  I think the misconceptions come in with the phrase ""noise canceling"" - it is NOT going to block every noise, as I don\'t think anything will (short of turning the volume up to ear-shattering levels).Another issue - the earbud design.  I have owned another set of Sony headphones (non-ear-bud) for over two years now, and was extremely pleased with the sound; a friend of mine purchased the MDR-NC11A\'s, and told me how well they worked, so I decided to spend the cash (it was Sony, after all).  I have always hated earbuds, and have been amazed for years at people who were able to keep them in their ears while performing wild feats of gymnastics, where I was constantly readjusting them.  So, when I first took these out of the box and put the buds in my ears, I was shocked - they stayed in!  The suction is MORE than adequate, and I tried every-which-way to get them to fall out of my ears, but they stayed put.  The only issue I have with the earbuds is that the left one is weighed down a bit by the design of the wires leading to the noise-canceling unit, and it feels like it\'s being pulled out slowly at times; I\'ve had to readjust it occaisionally, but other than that, I love the design of the earbuds.  Plus, the headphones come with small, medium, and large ""suction cups,"" so you can adjust the fit.As far as sound quality - it\'s pretty good, and it\'s the only reason I am giving these headphones 4 stars, and not 5.  I own two iPods - a photo and a video - and bought them for use on the video, mostly.  I had to do a fair amount of adjusting on the iPod itself with EQ\'s to get them to match the sound quality of my original Sony non-ear-bud headphones, and even then it\'s just not quite the same.  I\'m sure the fact that they\'re earbuds contributes to that, but they\'re still fairly good.  Also, when you first put on the headphones, the volume is relatively low (I had to crank the volume on the headphones to max, then almost crank my iPod volume to nearly the max), but when you turn on the sound canceling, the volume does boost a bit.  Every sound-canceling pair of headphones I\'ve ever had does this, and you do sacrifice a bit of volume for the noise-canceling feature.Overall - I\'m pretty pleased with the headphones, they do exactly what I bought them to do:  block out annoying co-workers\' voices.  I would definitely spend the money again.  However, if you\'re looking for super-good sound quality, you may look at a non-ear-bud headphone design.',)"

"(""I freely admit, I am writing this at the sunset rather than beginning of the Titanium PowerBook's technological lifecycle.  But, as a died in the wool Wintel person, what is really remarkable is that, after a hiatus of about 10 years, I have bought a Macintosh again.  You can blame this on a combination of three things - one of my computers died, I needed a portable, and I just bought an iPod.  Supporting the latter, and getting my ears onto iTunes was the deciding factor.There is no question that the Titanium is a superb computer.  It is every bit as fast as my Pentiums, it is beautifully designed, and the 15 inch screen is a big plus for my tired eyes.  But what is really amazing is the overall slickness of the operating system and its standard software.  I was setting up a wireless network for myself when I bought the PowerBook.  Literally the only thing I had to do to get it to fit in was to tell it to activate its internal Airport.  Meanwhile, I am still fighting glitches in my windows machines.  I plugged in my iPod, my cell phone, and my PDA and when I ran iSync I got all three devices and the Powerbook to synchronise.  And this is typical of OSX's approach to seamless operation.The Powerbook excels at graphics and music work, and that is where my interests lie.  The included software provides basic functionality which can be fleshed out with a host of excellent software.  And the Powerbook is certainly strong enough to run them.  With a built in DVD burner as well as both USB2 and FireWire 400 connectors you can accessorize and gadgetize this machine to your hearts content.Of course, there is a price to pay.  OSX is different at heart than any Windows OS.  Not in big ways, but in countless little deviations that will take a bit of acclimatization.  Even purchased software life Microsoft Office will do unexpected things on occasion.  I heartily recommend that you don't fall for Apple's &quot;you don't need a manual&quot; hype and go out and buy one of those 700 page volumes that ramble their way through the host of Macintosh features.  The more you find out about this machine, the better it gets."",)"
"(""All my life, I've used cameras that require film. Two weeks ago, my wife and I acquired our first digital, the POWERSHOT S45, and last week gave it an initial workout at Bryce, Zion, and Grand Canyon national parks. This review is by no means exhaustive as I've yet to master all of the camera's features; it's a summary of relatively superficial first impressions.The bottom line is that this 4 megapixel device takes impressively good pictures of such high detail resolution that my wife, a graphic designer, expects to use its output in PhotoShop for her professional work. It's small enough to be easily held in one hand, and is so light as to be barely  noticeable when carried in a small padded bag hung around the neck. (The old 35 mm was a millstone in comparison.) The silvery finish is smudge resistant, as when handled with fingers made greasy with french fries.You may wish to purchase an extra rechargeable lithium battery. After neglecting to re-energize it overnight after taking some ten snaps, the battery pooped out the next day (in the middle of our Bryce exploration) after taking an additional fifty-eight shots. Of course, being new to the digital experience, we were using up a lot of power constantly reviewing our photo masterpieces on the LCD screen. In any case, the power cell recharges surprisingly quickly. Also, we thought it prudent to purchase the larger 256 MB CompactFlash card (for in-camera image storage) to replace the 32 MB card provided.Speaking of the screen, it's fairly small at1.5 x 1.12 inches, and its display is very difficult to see in bright sunlight. And, if you need glasses to read small print, keep them handy to decipher the system's on-screen icons.While the 3x optical zoom lens is swell as far as it goes, the inability to attach a polarizer filter can be immensely aggravating under certain conditions.The shutter button's surface is smooth and entirely flush with the camera body; I was insecure enough to have to constantly check that my finger was on the button.One of the camera's greatest strong points is its wealth of features. For the digital novice, this versatility is perhaps an initial disadvantage since it'll take effort and time to become knowledgeable and well-practiced in all of them. Indeed, the 181-page user guide is a prodigious read. But, it is, to the extent that I've so far digested it, commendably comprehensive and easy to understand (with a plethora of illustrations).The provided software and transfer cable made uploading of each day's output to our PC laptop completely effortless. (My wife would subsequently transfer the image files to a CD for future manipulation in PhotoShop on her Mac.)My wife takes a lot of pictures that leave me rolling my eyes and shaking my head. Unfortunately, the digital nature of the POWERSHOT S45 leaves me unarmed with the old argument, &quot;You're wasting film!&quot; Isn't technology wonderful?"",)"
"('It works but I find the connection loose and if you move it, you hear static.',)"

"('works as described order came on time and their was no problems.  What is with the required number of words?',)"
"('I think the first thing that must be said is that this lens takes great pictures. The IS works really well and allows hand-held use, even in relatively dim light, if you are willing to crank up the ISO enough. I have taken some pictures I was very pleased with at about 7pm in the evening by using ISO 800 and, upon occasion, ISO 1600. Otherwise this lens needs either a monopod or, preferably, a tripod.The barrel slides in and out smoothly making it easy to frame your picture and the auto-focus works well. Fast and quiet. I have not had a problem with the AF hunting except in very low light. Except at 400mm the pictures are sharp and clear and, when the lens is fully open, the DOF is nice and slim allowing the subjects of the photo to really stand out. Even at 400mm this lens is much better than my Tamron 200-400 in terms of clarify and, what softness I did find at 400mm, was easily corrected in Photoshop. All in all a very nice lens except that  ...1) This lens is heavy. I know other people have said the same thing, but it did not become clear to me until I tried to use this lens as a ""walk-around"" lens. After about 30 minutes it started to become a real problem. And, because I was using this lens on an entry level DSLR (the Canon T1i) it felt as though the lens was not secure in the camera mount. The lens is so much heavier than the camera.2) This lens is long and there is no lens lock switch as on some other zoom lenses. There is a barrel tension adjustment which, I suppose, is supposed to help keep the lens from ""creeping"", but it did not prevent the lens from extending to its full length when I used it. Since the lens, including the lens hood, is 14"" long when extended, I found the lens handing down to my knees if I did not hold the lens when walking.3) Canon provides a very nice padded lens case, but no case strap. The vendor I bought this from (Canoga Camera) provided a lens strap, but it was thin and without padding so using it became painful after a bit. It might be worth purchasing a padded lens case strap.4) Obviously, because of the length of this length even when closed, you cannot expect to use the built-in flash without creating unsightly shadows in your picture, but I had no problems using even my small (270EX) Canon SpeedLite.5) A comment. Some reviewers have warned against using cheap UV filters. I bought a UV filter which I believed to be just fine, but it caused really unsightly blurring in the pictures I took when I viewed them at 40% or more. I initially thought the problem was the lens and could not believe such an expensive lens would take such bad pictures. But after I removed the filter and re-took the pictures I realized that the problem was the filter, not the lens. Be careful if you buy a UV filter to make sure it does not adversely affect your pictures.I use my camera and lenses mostly away from home. I like to hike through the National Parks in the West and that generally means climbing up and down on a regular basis. Given that usually I also carry either a monopod or a tripod, it makes it difficult to use this lens as a ""walk-around"" lens. I need one hand to hold the lens, another to hold the monopod and a third to help me get up or down some of the hills. So to use this lens I would have to leave it in the case (swinging back and forth as I climb) so that I have at least one hand free, or use a back pack. Either of those means leaving the lens un-mounted and having to then constantly mount and un-mount the lens to take pictures.Given all of this I would recommend this lens if you expect to use it close to home (or car, or camp site) and do not expect to have to do much hiking. Under these circumstances this is a wonderful lens. Otherwise you are going to have to be constantly mounting and un-mounting it to take pictures. Not only is that trouble, but it means you are going to lose a lot of spontaneous shots because you will not be prepared.If, like I, you expect to be climbing or walking in rough areas, I would recommend a smaller lens. I reluctantly returned this lens and expect to replace it with the Canon 70-300 DO. It won\'t have the reach, and may not have the IQ, but it will be easy to use and I will be ready to use it.',)"
"(""I recently upgraded to a full frame camera and needed to replace mySigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras(That lens is designed for APS-C sensors, and was useless on the 5D).  I figured that with a 1.6x crop factor, my old 10-20 should be equivalent to this 20mm.I am a real estate photographer and videographer.  When I'm doing outdoor pictures, this lens can get the job done.  It lets me fit a whole building in the frame without trying to take the picture from 10 miles away, and in good light, there is ZERO vignetting and minimal loss of sharpness in the corners.  Be aware that this lens is nothing like a tilt shift, and your horizontal lines are going to bow out like crazy.  If you're doing more artsy photography this might be fine.  For me, I try to avoid it with the old tricks, and correct it in Photoshop if needed.Indoor shooting is another story.  I try to avoid flash most of the time because it either falls off, adding to the vignetting or ruins the contrast of the image (Shadows help the human brain understand the depth of a scene) so I'm normally shooting wide open at 400ISO with my shutter speed as slow as I dare.  Here I run into MASSIVE vignetting.  While this IS correctable in Adobe Camera RAW, the process is like boosting your ISO, it also boosts the noise.In addition, 20mm still isn't quite as wide as I probably need for indoor shooting.  If your subject is anything but the room its self, you'll be fine, but in my case it just isn't quite cutting it.If you are shooting artistically, or shooting small subjects, I would rate this lens 4.5 stars.  For my uses, I give it three.Pros:It is quite wideIn good light, the center of the frame is sharpThe weight is manageableCaptures great colorPrice isn't too badCons:Heavy vignetting in low light / indoorsHigh vertical distortionNo lens hood included! (And the one you can buy here isn't great)At 21MP, a best case photo at 100% isn't very sharp (If you're scaling images down, you'll be fine here)"",)"
"('I bought this lens right before an overseas vacation to supplement the kit zoom lensCanon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerasthat came with my Canon D50.  I thought the zoom lens would be my primary lens, but I ended up leaving the zoom lens in the bag more often than I had thought and used this one the most. I bought this primarily as a portrait lens but it performed so well at a variety of tasks and turned out to be much more versatile than I had expected.Our trip was for a month.  I did have to shoot a wedding, but the rest of the time was purely personal. Don\'t get me wrong - the 28-135 did good, but after a few hundred shots I noticed a pattern of overall better color under natural light conditions AND better auto-focus on the subjects with the EF 85.  Of course, fixed focal length lenses such as the EF 85 typically have fewer elements in fewer groups than zoom lenses, which as a rule of thumb should produce better images.While reviewing the wedding photos, I noticed that the EF 85 was more likely to focus on the subject\'s face than the 28-135, which tended to focus on who knows what - the clothing maybe?  I was using auto-focus with both lenses, but was sometimes getting slightly blurry shots when using the zoom lens.  I discarded more photos taken with the 28-135 zoom, and had I know this prior to the wedding I would have used the EF 85 more often.Once the wedding was over and I was just shooting for fun, there were a couple of times that I noticed a ""busy"" message on my camera that temporarily prevented me from shooting.  I was both perplexed and upset.  It said my battery still had plenty of power, I wasn\'t using the flash, and my memory card is fast and was far from full, so I couldn\'t determine what the problem was.  The second time this happened I realized I had been using the zoom lens both times, so I switched over to the EF 85, and the problem went away.  After a lot of research I learned that the IS system on certain IS lenses can cause temporary delays while compensating for low light or motion, but since the EF 85 does not have IS, there are no IS-compensaton delays.  That being said, this lens performs just fine even without a tripod (unlike longer teles).Towards the end of our trip I was visiting the United Nations\' Joint Security Area in the middle of the DMZ between North and South Korea, and they have a strict lens length limit of 90mm, no exceptions.  A couple of people only had longer zoom lenses or teles, and they ended up having to leave their cameras behind - what a disappointment!  By this time I was quite comfortable with the EF 85, and once again it exceeded my expectations.  I always shoot in the highest quality mode (full ""L"" + RAW), and I was getting crystal-clear photos even when shooting from a slow-moving vehicle, and I was able to shoot at a rate of several photos per second.  Again, great clarity, color, and the auto-focus was always spot-on.Keep in mind that in the days of film cameras, the best portrait lens length was somewhere above 80mm.  For Canon APS-C cameras (non full-frame) like the EOS 50D, 7D, and Rebel models, this 85mm lens length would be the equivalent of a 136mm lens if it were on a film camera.  For full-frame models such as the EOS 1D and 5D, this lens is the equivalent of 111mm.  This translates into perfect portrait depth-of-field and produces awesome boke in the f/1.8 - f/2.0 range, and even a decent amount of boke up to f/4.5.  But this lens can do so much more than just portraits - the fast f/1.8 aperture is much wider than most zoom lenses, yet the cost, weight, and length are relatively small.  In short, an indispensable, very convenient lens.I couldn\'t be happier with this lens.  The Ultra-Sonic motor works silently and flawlessly.  As with all lenses, I would recommend using a lens hood and/or a QUALITY filter (think B+W UV MRC seriesB+W 58mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010) to protect the lens and limit unwanted light.  L-series lenses come with their own hood, but for this lens you must purchase it separatelyCanon ET65III Lens Hood for Canon SLR Lens.*** UPDATE ***  I recently added theCanon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR CamerasAND theCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerasto my lineup.

I can\'t say it\'s exactly the same level as L-series glass, but it\'s pretty damn close.',)"
"('Have been debating on getting the 85mm for some time. So I finally got to rent the two lens (1.8 and 1.2L) for 1.5 hours. My test scenario was in a park in really frigidtemperatures. My subject was a kid that hardly stood in one place for a minute. I purposely chose the subject to test the speed of the lens.Here are my observations1) SharpnessBoth the lens is very very sharp. I couldn\'t believe that 85mm 1.8 can be sharp wide openSo if you are looking for sharpness wide open they both are the same. And the sharpness is the same tooIf you open a 85mm 1.2L shot at 1.2 and 85mm 1.8 at 1.8 and crop it, the sharpness is the same.Both the lens at some point got shots that made me say ""holy crap thats super duper sharp""2) Bokeh.Now there are two scenarios (again 85mm 1.2L shot at 1.2 and 85mm 1.8 at 1.8)1) The subject is close. A very tight headshot.verdict: The bokeh is close. Very close. Unless you keep them side by side you wont know whichlens took which photo2) If you are taking a wider shot. So subject in the middle (full body) and surroundings.verdict: There is a difference here. Here you will see the bokeh to be better in the 1.2LThat is a great look. 1.8 is good but the 1.2 is great. I thinkits possible to get that enhanced blur with Photoshop blur.3) Speed.The reason why I chose a child was to test the focal speed. And trust me I had quite a challengechasing the kid1) 85mm 1.2 L.Speed is good. I got the child in focus most of the time. I think it is fast enough for most shootsexcept scenarios of very different distances in-between shots. For example to shoot the child on aswing. Not possible. But if the child moves or even jogs a bit you can get it.So unless you are shooting a subject that moves few feet in few secs you are really good.2) 85mm 1.8.Speed is great. Its fast, really fast. I could nail shots on a swing. You can do the predictive shooting.4) Low lightDue to the cold we kept moving back to the car to warm up. It was dark inside and I got the opportunityto test the low light focusing ability.1) 85mm 1.2 L.This lens is a killer in low light. In low light this has no problem in focusing.2) 85mm 1.8.This one struggled a bit but got the shots.So here are my observationsSharpness - Both are the same wide openBokeh - Same when the subject is close but when far away and wider shots 85L wins by 30%. Must add the bokeh at 1.2L is 35% better than the 1.8 wide openSpeed - 85mm 1.8 wins (But 85mm 1.2L was no slouch. I got 95% of a fast moving child in focus.)Low Light - 85mm 1.2L wins hands down (But 85mm 1.8 also focused it struggled a bit. Say 20%. I did not try really dark light)Other observations. 85mm 1.2L Lens feels like a metal canon ball and feels awesome in hand and as you have read the construction feels great.I loved the bokeh in 1.8L when I shot wider Can I get it via Photoshop, I think I can.So if you have the time to do it in Photoshop, the 1.8 will give you more than a starting point.

"('UPDATE 11/10:  After messing with its assigned IP settings while trying to get it to come back to life following switching to a new wireless router, I thought I\'d bricked the damn thing when even the software downloaded online for setup for my OS (Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit) wouldn\'t find it.  Tech support is slow (10 minutes to answer), based overseas,  and civil though not exactly warm.  HOWEVER, these guys know their stuff and will get you out of the woods.  When the ""wizard"" software won\'t cut it, you\'ll be needing such expertise, so good show Trendnet!  When this thing is good, it\'s VERY, VERY GOOD!!!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I\'m incredibly pleased with this little device which has added years to the life of my never-say-die NEC SuperScript 870 printer and the years\' worth of toner I had stocked for it.  Parallel port, non-networking dinosaurs become 25th century androids again, and considering how printers these days are almost as disposable as their ink cartridges, that\'s a good thing.As others reported, installation was pretty quick, although you definitely must use the disc included for this task.  It will find many legacy printers to suggest drivers for, but if one does not specifically exist for your printer on your operating system, it won\'t work.  I had to cobble together a driver using some advice on a board for my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, and found that once again, you must add the printer using the included disk rather that just Windows wizards.It requires a power source.  I wish this were dual voltage (120V only) since I move overseas regularly, but that\'s picking nits.  It\'s also a bit odd that it doesn\'t show up on my router as network item, but as long as my computers see it as a printer option, I\'m satisfied.',)"

"(""I recently got a Canon SD500 Elph (wonderful camera) and this case for it.  The case fits just right, goes on your belt or in your pocket, opens and closes quickly with a Velcro flap, gives you quick access and portability, and good protection for ordinary use.  I'm delighted with it, it's perfect for the camera and for nearly every situation.I nearly didn't get this case after reading some of the negative reviews here on Amazon.  Don't believe them!  I gambled, because how much could I lose?  Nothing, as it turns out.  I'm delighted with this case -- and I'm very particular about my camera cases.  A camera is a substantial investment, and I want quality and function to protect my baby.  Some people here have said that the leather is so thin that the case is only cosmetic and doesn't offer protection.  NOT TRUE!  The leather is NOT paper thin but fairly substantial, a good feel to it, and with the stiff protruding stiched edges on the side and the bulk of the Velcro flap in front there indeed IS cushioning to protect your precious camera.  And as I said, I very much care about this.  If you whack your camera onto tabletops or drop it from 6 feet to a concrete floor you'll probably break it.  So don't do that.  Unless you slap your precious high-precision baby around like a drunken gorilla, you do not need a bulky mattress of a case.  This one does in fact give the protection you need for nearly every situation.Another complaint aired here is that it's a nuisance to thread the camera's cord through the slot in the case's flap each time.  Well, that's true for every small camera case.  I've had several compact cameras, and I NEVER thread the carrying cord through the case flap.  Why would you?  Just give it a couple quick folds on top of the camera and flip down the Velcro flap and bingo!  Fits perfectly.  All tucked away -- and ready for a quick draw when a picture beckons.Another gripe heard here is that you can't put a spare battery or memory card in the case.  Folks, this is an ultracompact snapshooter, not a safari rig.  You want it with you and ready on a moment's notice, so that you don't miss those precious memories as they're happening.  Because of its compact size, you're much more likely to carry a small case than a bulky one, so you'll have it with you instead of leaving it at home.  There's really no hesitation to strap this case on your belt or toss it in your pocket, because it's small.  That way you'll have the camera with you, instead of sitting in the drawer.  And how many times will you actually need that spare card?  The SD500 with a 1 GB card (which I got -- you should too, you'll love the extra memory) will take nearly 150 pictures.  Other Elphs will also hold a lot of shots.  How many snaps will you take before uploading?  If it's 200 or more, put another SD card in your pocket.  Some of you probably haven't seen one of these amazing things, so I'll tell you that an SD memory card is TINY.  And the spare battery is very small.  On those heavy snapshooting days when you'll take hundreds of shots (how often is that?) you will not bulk up any of your pockets with with these amazing, tiny gizmos.The inside of the case is soft and velvety and will not scratch the camera at all, another gripe I saw here.  I suppose if you slam the little camera in and out and grind away at it, it might be possible to inflict wounds, but for those who are less than gorillas with their gear it's a nice, soft environment inside.If you plan to do serious trekking in hazardous environments, buy a second case with all sorts of bulk and pockets.  Then you're covered for those serious vacation events, but that's likely to be an occasional need, if at all.  For everything else, this case is what the doctor ordered.  It's functional, high quality, compact, protective and on top of that it's attractive.  My only suggestion is that Canon should include it with the camera, because it's like a natural part of the kit.Once you have this case you'll be delighted, and, like me, you'll wonder how anyone could make any sort of fuss over it.  It's just right.  And -- you'll use it all the time."",)"

"(""Bought this to network my iMac upstairs with my PowerMac downstairs. Since it isn't Mac friendly to set up, it took a few extra steps. So far it works flawlessly. It has a good range, and I have had no problems."",)"
"('First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.  Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR. You have a chance if you\'re a good cookbook recipe follower.  Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there\'s no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought. Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.  It\'s not here yet!Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.  The reason is simple, one word, and ""security"".  The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprotected Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it. They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.  In some cases, you can\'t even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.  It\'s no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.  Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.  You\'ll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.  Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?  For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.  A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.  Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address from the cable modem you are using.  Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what\'s recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.  In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.  Networks on the outside can\'t see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can\'t be seen can\'t be accessed.  Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware. This is what is commonly called a firewall.  You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.Here is where many typical problems begin.  Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.  You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.  These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.  With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, ""the wireless connection"".  Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.  You are really the ones that need this the most.  Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.  Don\'t try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?  Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.  I\'m trying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.  This model appears to be especially good.Why the four-port wireless model you ask? You may only have one computer.  True, you don\'t need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.  Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.  If that happens, you\'ll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices. Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.  What about the wireless capability, you ask.  Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet. This is especially true if you don\'t need the speed of a wired connection.  Don\'t worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.  Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router. As said before, you may get some conflicts.  The other issue is how secure do you want it.  You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.  Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.  Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won\'t even let you connect to play.  It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues. However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer less secure.  You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers. They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.  It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.  Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.  Let\'s put it this way, it\'s a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security. The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days.',)"
"('Individuals should really specify which hardware version they\'re reviewing. There have been at least three versions of the WAP54G, with reviews for all evidently (based on review dates) lumped together here. This review is for the latest hardware version (3.1).The current WAP54G has been set up to function right out of the box using the default settings. In other words, most wireless devices should connect without any changes, as my two netbooks did. However, to avoid confusion with other nearby wireless networks (the neighbor, etc), you\'ll want to change your wireless network\'s name (SSID). Likewise, to avoid any unauthorized intrusions or snooping, you\'ll want to change the default password (""admin"") and add data encryption.The easiest way to do this is to run the Setup Wizard CD on a computer connected to your wired network. The Setup Wizard will take you step-by-step through each process with explanations and occasional advice (this is better, write this down, etc). If you want to run the Setup Wizard on your computer without the CD, simply copy the folder from the CD to your ""Program Files"" folder and add shortcuts to the ""Start"" menu. Delete the folder and shortcuts to uninstall.Another setup method, assuming the client device you\'re connecting also has this capability, is to use the SecureEasySetup feature. Run the Setup Wizard and follow the on-screen instructions. At some point, you\'ll press the SecureEasySetup buttons on both devices (the glowing ""Cisco Systems"" logo on the WAP54G and wherever on the client) and the SSID (network name) and WPA-Personal (WPA-PSK) key will be generated on their own. You\'ll see the result in the Setup Wizard. Only one SecureEasySetup device is allowed. Other devices must be set up manually (previous paragraph). By the way, if a client device does not have this capability, it\'s probably a good idea to stay well away from the SecureEasySetup button on the front of the WAP54G.With no experience with the WAP54G and very little experience with wireless networking, I was quickly able (using Setup Wizard) to connect the WAP54G to my wired network (two PC\'s, D-Link switch, & broadband router) and set up a secured (WPA-PSK) wireless network including two ASUS EeePC 1000HE netbooks. The entire process took less than an hour (much easier than expected), most of that time spent carefully reading the manual or on-screen instructions in the Setup Wizard and testing the settings.There were a couple of small surprises. For example, after I initially connected to the WAP54G as described in the second paragraph above (no security, etc), the netbook obviously no longer connected after security was added and I could not figure out how to get out of the original wireless connection. Luckily, after double-clicking on that connection in the ""View Available Wireless Networks"" screen, Windows XP decided it was a bad connection and deleted it. When I refreshed the network list, there was my desired wireless network.After everything was set up, I roamed around the house with each netbook to check the wireless signal strength and test internet access. House is a modern cement split-level with main floor entrance and downstairs facing rear fenced yard. Signal strength is very good or better throughout, with the only weak spot (poor signal) on the toilet in the main floor bathroom - behind a metal washer & dryer roughly 45-feet from the WAP54G with five cement walls between. However, I was still able to access the internet. Moving the netbook out from behind the washer & dryer increased signal strength to very good.Overall, I\'m very satisfied with the Linksis WAP54G. The blue faceplate isn\'t very attractive and it\'s a bit too easy to accidently press the SecureEasySetup button, but I was able to accomplish what I want without any major fuss and wireless range is pretty good with no disconnects so far.',)"
"(""I wanted to connect a wired computer to my wireless network, so I bought one of these, and a WRT54G router (which I needed anyway) which claims to act like a Access Point (it does but..), spent several hours attempting to configure it. Then used the on line linksys help (via the web) and then was told that in Access Client mode, this device will only connect to another WAP54G device. So bought the second one, configured the first to be an access Point, and the second one to be an access client. (pretty quickly as I'm now very familiar with the web based interface) And it works!First, it's a bit unnerving because have to configure each of the two devices one at a time using a computer attached to your router. Be sure to set the IP address to different numbers. And you have to use WEP encription, no other option appears to work. And once you have both with seperate IP addresses you can configure everything but setting the AP CLient mode. Do that last with just the client mode box attached to your router.Then to test it, first disconnect the AP Client from the router, then be sure that the other Access Point is connected and reachable (bring up the web page), then disconnect your computer from the router, and plug it into the AP Client box. It should work.A couple of notes, the AP Client works with the WRT54G router/Access Point IFF you turn all the encryption off. (This is why I spent so much time before calling in the online help. I kept thinking I had it set up correctly, then turning up the security levels and having it fail....) Of course I do not recommend this mode at all. Which makes me wonder why you can't make a WRT54G do the right thing, but you can't. And there is a diagram on the linksys website which shows the correct configuration. It just took me several looks to understand exactly what it saying. (that the WRT54G in access point mode is not equivalent to a WAP54G).Second, skip the stupid installation CD, go to the linksys site and find out the default IP address, and configure it using that.Third, look up the suggestions for increasing the security for your wireless network, and configure your boxs appropriately once you have it working on your test machine. (turn off SSID broadcast, disable configuration management from wireless devices, change the password etc.)Be sure to use a different channel than your other wireless router. (I still wanted to connect a different computer wirelessly to the WRT54G) And use the search for networks scan to see what channels the neighbors are using and pick a different one from them too if possible.On the speed issue, I've got a pretty small house so I regularly get the full 54Mps of data transfer. It's pretty nice. You need to pay attention to all the other comments about getting the antennas aligned to point from each of the two access points to each other for best reception. Not hard, but worth doing.And if all this becomes too confusing, use the Web based help from Linksys, the person I had was very helpful. (Be sure that your drivers are the most up-to-date as that will be the first thing they will ask you to do.)"",)"

"(""The two complaints most often leveled against KVMs are: (1) video degradation, and (2) hardware incompatibility.  I have not encountered either in using the Belkin F1DJ102PB for the past month.I am running 2 Dells, one with W98 and the other XP-Home, through the Belkin to an Optiquest/Viewsonic Q95 monitor at 1152x864 and 85hz. The keyboard is a vanilla Dell keyboard and the mouse is a Microsoft Wheelmouse Optical. There have been zero problems.I work with Excel spreadsheets all day long, staring at endless rows and columns of small font numbers. This makes me VERY fussy about video issues like ghosting, fuzziness and blurring.  I can detect absolutely NO difference in video quality when using the KVM as opposed to running straight from PC to monitor.The switch's maximum video bandwidth is 200Mhz. If you are using very high screen resolutions with high refresh rates (say something higher than 1600x1200x100hz=192Mhz), this could become an issue.The mouse worked immediately on the Dell on which is was originally installed and, once I installed its drivers on the other machine (a step that I think many forget - and then complain about hardware problems), it worked fine there as well.The unit itself is small and has cable connectors on all 4 sides.  Once everything is connected, this arrangement can be somewhat ungainly - a big electronic spider.  I have placed mine on the floor underneath my desk.  This means I must use the keyboard shortcut to change between machines rather than the button on the switch itself, but I think I would do that anyway - its so easy.  Hit the ScrollLock key twice and then either the up or down arrow key (BUT - only the arrow keys in the cursor keypad - not the ones under the '8' and the '2').Every time you change from one machine to the other, the KVM emits a little chirp. I would like to strangle that little chirp, but this is my only complaint about the unit.  It is an inexpensive (especially when you consider that Belkin has included the cables) but entirely satisfactory piece of equipment.  Highly recommended."",)"
"('I just built my first two computers and used these cases, the Antec Sonata, to do it.  Having read lots of reviews and looked at lots of cases, I decided on the Sonata because of its power supply, solid steel construction, and relatively inconspicuous looks.The included power supply is the Antec True 380S, the ""silent"" version of Antec\'s wildly popular True 380; the difference between the two is that the 380S only has a single rear-vented fan. It certainly came with plenty of power connectors, and is indeed very quiet.  My only complaint is that it gave off an electrical burning smell for a few days, which I had been warned about on message boards; my Harman Kardon AV receiver gave off the same smell when it was new, so I\'m chalking it up to large power supplies.The case is very nicely laid out for optimal low front to high rear airflow.  The front intake is cleverly concealed and has a changeable air filter. The large 120mm rear fan is also very silent when connected to the dedicated fan power supply.  I went for further silence in the form of Sapphire\'s OEM version of the Radeon 9700, which comes with a giant Zalman ZM-80 heat pipe, and a Sapphire OEM version of the Radeon 9000 pro, which is also fanless.  The dominant noise now is the retail boxed fan that came with my two Pentium processors; under heavy load (and I do a lot of CPU-intensive scientific computing), these fans can get noisy, as can both disk and optical drives, so be careful with those components, too, if you really want quiet. Putting the optical drives behind a closable door provides additional sound dampening.The hardest part was getting it open the first time, at least for a novice.  Turns out you just need to pull up on the plastic lever on the back of one sides of the case and everything you need is packed inside.  I was blown away by how instructive the manual was; together with the manual from the motherboard (ASUS P4C800), I was able to build two computers without much other input.Installation of the mother board is easy.  The optical and floppies also fit in nicely on their cleverly packed plastic tracks. There are 3 5.25"" external bays and two 3.25"" external bays behind the drive cover.  There\'s additional room for four well-spaced out hard drives. Here Antec took a left turn and modified the usual drive arrangement 90 degrees.  Mounted on Antec\'s rails, my Seagate Serial ATA drives had to be installed backwards; in the other machine, the IBM/Hitachi Deskstars just barely squeaked in mounted forward.In terms of looks, the piano black is a nice touch, and matches both the piano and my PSB Stratus mini-monitor speakers.  Unfortunately, there are three glaring flaws in the beauty of this case.  First is the cheap-looking plastic slider over the front panel ports (USB, firewire, analog audio); the lock is not as distracting as you might imagine, but I\'ve never seen anyone lock their computer box, so I don\'t see the point.  The second distraction is the way Antec has spelled their name in drilled holes across the tops of both sides of the case.  This totally destroys the ""generic"" look, as well as allowing unfiltered air into the case and releasing more sound.',)"
"(""This is my first camcorder. I also have a Canon S30 (3.0 mp). I bought the ZR70 based on my experience with Canon and the feature set. I'll start with my positive impressions:-The 22x optical zoom is great. I feel confident inknowing that I'll probably never need a longer zoom. Idon't even need to use the digital zoom with the ZR70.-The feature set for this camera is impressive. It hasmany digital effects and scene transitions. However, withmost video editing software, any effect not included withthe camcorder can be added in with a computer.-The battery life is pretty good. It will outlast an 80minute tape. The battery charges in the camera, but anexternal charger is offered by Canon.-The ZR70 is compact and fits easily into my hand. It isalmost as small (and light) as my S-30.-Most importantly, the image quality (video) is impressiveoutdoors and in a well lit roomThe negative:-If the room is not well lit, expect a lot of grain. Also,the 'super night mode' has little to offer. The light onthe front of the ZR70 is blinding and doesn't help theimage quality. However, while the grain is very noticeableon my computer, once burned to a DVD and played on my largescreen TV, the grain is much less noticeable.-The camera does pick up motor noise. It isn't that loud,but keep in mind that it will be in all of the movies youtake. You can buy an external microphone, but as I've notused one, I can't comment on any improvement it may offer.-The digital camera mode is a joke. 1024x768 is a decentresolution, but the camera picks up so much noise (grain)in the images that they are almost unuseable. This is tobe expected in most camcorders however, and I have my S-30,which takes great shots. (Don't expect great stills froma camcorder OR great video from a digital camera)-The image stabilization isn't that great.  Thats to be expected though, with the long zoom.In conclusion:I don't know if I would recommend the ZR70. I was close to returning it myself, but didn't want to go through the hassel. I mainly compared the ZR70 to the current offerings by Sony (TRV33, etc.). The reviews for the Sonys are good, but I can't get past the touch screen LCD. In my opinion, that is a very impractical way to control the camcorder. If you won't be using the camcorder in darkness frequently and don't mind the soft motor noise, the ZR70 is a good buy. Hopefully Canon will address the low light grain and the motor noise in their future products.**Update**A few days ago my camcorder's CCD failed, resulting in the camera recording a black screen in any of the recording modes.  HOWEVER, after calling Canon, they've agreed to repair it at no charge to me (even picked up the shipping costs).  This greatly impressed me (the camcorder is 2 years old).  For those of you who have had this happen, call Canon technical support.  They did not say this directly, but it seems to be a well known issue and will be repaired out of warranty for free."",)"
"('I bought these Sennheiser PXC 250 noise-reducing headphones as a replacement for my trusty HDC 451\'s, which were excellent.  For straight noise reduction, the PXC 250 is definitely better.  But as a wear-it-everywhere set of headphones to improve one\'s overall quality of life, the PXC 250 still leaves something to be desired.  (For this latter usage, the HDC 451 might still be a wiser choice.)  Here\'s a rundown of the PXC 250\'s pros and cons.On the positive side, noise reduction for the PXC 250 is up 50% versus the HDC 451, going from 10 dB to 15 dB of noise suppression.  Quietness is further enhanced by the 250\'s on-the-ear, cup-style listening units.  The earphones also twist to lie flat, and the headband folds in two places to make the PXC 250 even smaller for stowing.  The 250 even comes with its own black carrying case, which has a zippered pocket on the outside which is perfect for hiding the included "" audio and two-pronged airline adapter plugs.On the downside, the battery carrying case (which also houses the electronics) has grown significantly - even though the battery size has been reduced from two (2) AA\'s to a pair of AAA\'s.  The batteries are held in-line, rather than side-by-side.  So the case for the PXC is about as long and thick as a short cigar, whereas the compartment for the HDC 451 is about the size of a box of Tic Tac mints.The most bothersome feature of the PXC 250, though, are the dual wires emerging from the earphones (one for each side), which are probably required since the headband now breaks in two places.  The wires, besides being more numerous, are also fairly thin -- which causes them to get tangled much more often when storing and unstoring them (as compared to the HDC 451 which has a single, thicker wire).Lastly, the increased quietness of the PXC 250\'s enclosed ear cups, although superior for blocking noise, are no longer an ""open air"" style - which makes hearing ambient sounds and other people\'s voices more difficult.  The PXC 250 is thus best suited to indoor (or stationary) music listening only, and are perhaps a little too insulating for using outdoors (or while moving or interacting with others).In short, if enjoying music indoors (or on a plane) is your objective, the PXC 250 is definitely the way to go.  If, on the other hand, you\'d like to bring sanity to a noisy world by wearing your headphones everywhere, then the older HDC 451 is probably a smarter choice.I\'d like to suggest to the company (Sennheiser) that they also consider offering a behind-the-neck style so that outdoor users (like yours truly) can enjoy the benefits of superior noise reduction - while wearing a hat!  And there\'s definitely something to be learned from the new Bose QuietComfort 2\'s (which are unfortunately bigger and much more expensive) which incorporate the electronics into the headphones themselves.  This design allows the audio cord to be completely detached - which takes everyday noise suppression to a whole new level of convenience.To conclude, I\'ve tried a variety of affordably priced noise-reducing headphones and earphones from Sony, Aiwa and others.  From my own experiences, the Sennheiser PXC 250 and HDC 451 are definitely the best!  And I certainly wouldn\'t want to live life without them!',)"
"(""I bought these headphones a couple months ago to use with a Creative Zen Micro MP3 player, because (1) I knew I had to upgrade to something better than the included earbuds, and (2) I wanted something with noise canceling ability to take with me when I periodically fly to the east coast. And I have never been a Bose fan, I'll take fidelity over artificial booming bass any day :)So far I have been very happy with these headphones. They are not cheap (I got them here on a brief special offer, which helped ease the pain a little), but in my opinion, these headphones are definitely worth the money.First, as far as the noise canceling goes: like other reviewers have stated, you have to know what to expect. Total noise isolation? No way. But these phones do a great job of blocking out low-frequency background noise, while preserving input audio quality, with very little 'noise' added. I have not had the opportunity to take them on an airplane, but I've been using them in the office daily, and they do an admirable job of getting rid of the rumble of three computer fans and the air conditioning. The noise canceling makes a huge difference, especially at low audio volumes. Very impressive! When turned on, a slight amplification of the input signal is apparent, accompanied by a tiny amount of high-frequency hiss, not disturbing at all though.Audio quality, with or without noise canceling, is of course way better than with the cheap earbuds you get for free with MP3 players. The PXC250's are not audiophile standard, as are the top of the line Sennheisers (e.g. the HD650), but they produce clear, well-balanced sound, free of any perceptible distortion and with good, tight bass response. I've tried these on my home theater system and I was suitably impressed - very typical neutral Sennheiser sound. Like most audio equipment of decent quality, they seem to improve after a break-in period.The phones are very comfortable to wear: light-weight with adequate padding all round, probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. I can wear these for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue. The included carrying case and converter plugs are a nice touch, like everything with wires attached to it, it takes some time to get the hang of properly folding and stowing them, but they are certainly very portable. The construction seems sturdy enough and I expect these to last a long time with proper use and care.Something to consider: the input impedance is quite high (300 ohms, compared to the more typical 16-32 ohms of cheaper earbuds/phones), so to drive them properly you need some oomph. My Zen Micro manages to drive them to adequate volume levels (I plan on retaining my hearing for a while still), but if you insist on stretching your eardrums to bleeding levels, you may want to consider getting a headphone amplifier if you plan to use these with portable audio devices.All in all, I am very satisfied with my Sennheiser PXC250's."",)"
"(""I began my search for better quality headphones for my Creative Zen Touch after hearing a set of Bose $149 headphones at Target. They excited me, so I began my research at Amazon.com. I was immediately disappointed to learn how poorly the Bose held up under normal usage. I also became educated on some important decisions one must make before buying more expensive headphones: do you want open or closed design? Do you want more sensitive, and therefore possibly heavier, headphones that will almost certainly detect any compression of your audio files to mp3, for example? Or will you be using these with your home-based stereo system? I was looking for a set of closed headphones that were light weight and would not be terribly affected by mp3 compression, yet be responsive and accurate across the sound spectrum. The criticism of the poor bass response of the Sennheiser PX 200s, and the difficulty some folks were having stuffing them back into their carrying case, frightened me. However, on balance the reviews seemed good and, more than any other headphones I considered, seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for. So, I purchased these headphones, burned them in steadily for a period of five days straight, and now would not part with them for any reason. I am completely pleased with these, my first Sennheiser headphone experience. As most reviewers have said, the design and quality of this product are impressive. When I looked at the diagram on how to return them to their carrying case, I was able to accomplish the task the first time around, and in under a minute. As for the lack of a bass response: nonsense. It is true that you do not get the booming bass that you might expect if you're a fan of Hip Hop, however, I found the sound of these phones to be more realistic across the spectrum and easily adjustable by changing the Equalizer Settings on my Creative Zen Touch. These phones are sensitive enough to pick up the annoying artifacts of compression, but I found that this was only the case with those downloads or burns that had not been done at a high enough ratio. To sum it all up, I am very pleasantly surprised with the Sennheiser PX 200s, in light of the criticisms I read which, I have concluded, are simply a matter of taste and fit. So, if you're looking for quality, balance, and accuracy in your listening experience with a portable audio device, you need not worry about investing in these pleasing, comfortable, and very handy headphones.As an aside, I want to mention one negative element in my headphone purchasing experience. I discovered online that the Sennheiser PX 200s are also sold at Best Buy. So I decided to go there and try them out before buying a pair. At Best Buy they have these headphones displayed in their box and do not have a demo pair that you can try on. When I asked if I could open the box and give them a test drive, I was told no. The sales person suggested that I buy them and, if I didn't like them, I could bring them back within 30 days for a refund. How inconvenient! I would suggest to anyone reading this who may be in a supervisory position at Best Buy - change your policy!"",)"
"('They delivered very fast, but my player didn\'t recognise this thing as a disk. ""No Disk"", shutdown, end of story. The product description on this site should be more open about the risk of this. I\'ll try in on different machines, if it works at least somewhere, I\'ll keep it; if it doesn\'t work anywhere, I\'ll send it back. Beware: there\'s a good chance your player won\'t recognise this disk as anything disk-like, so search more for products that do not seem to suffer from that phenomenon. (PS. I\'m also glad to see the price went up since I bought it (less than a week ago, for seven-ninety). Why not make sure the product is usable before jacking up the price?).Update: tried it on my Toshiba machine: it worked ! Well, Toshiba didn\'t need cleaning, so I don\'t know how well this disk cleaned it, but at least it loaded and it talked to me explaining what was going on, and so on. So it does work on some players. So I\'ll keep it for that purpose. But still, I can\'t give it five stars \'cause it\'s temperamental and doesn\'t work for all players, and you never know if it\'s good for you or not. Three stars overall.Added on 02/12/2012: A few things in addition to the above a reader here might find useful: first, like I said, my player didn\'t recognise this DVD, so I left it alone. A couple of weeks ago though, for some reason I decided to play a DVD in it, and lo and behold, it played perfectly. So, it seems that while the player didn\'t see the disk, the brushes did flick dirt off of the lens while the lens was trying to read it. So, this disk did fix the player, despite anything else. But! That was a temporary success and today it started skipping and freezing again. That got me pissed off, and I decided to trash it and buy a new one. Then I thought, since it goes into the trash anyway, let me uncork it and see what\'s going on there: if I ruin it, it doesn\'t matter. So I opened the box and observed how things operate there. I found the lens, and wiped it with a Q-tip drenched in rubbing alcohol. Then I turned on my hair dryer and blew over the assembly a bit to dry it out. And, what do you know, that fixed it. The player now works like new. So, to morale is, you may not need any of these disks to being with: just wash the lens with rubbing alcohol (91%) and you\'re good.06/08/2012: In June 2012, about half a year after I wrote this review, the player did kick the bucket, so perhaps its earlier malfunctions were not _exclusively_ due to the lens (but it was at least somewhat related, because cleaning it gave the player a second life -- not a long one, but it did become useable for another half a year). I re-read the review, thinking maybe I need to change something, but I don\'t think there\'s anything in it that\'s invalidated by the player\'s recent demise. As a replacement I bought a small Sony player for thirty bucks in Sears and am entirely happy with it for now. I am still looking for a PAL-capable and region-unlocked machine (I have and buy a goodly number of PAL DVDs \'cause a lot of great stuff isn\'t released for the US), so if you have any recommendations, please share, I\'d really appreciate it. Today, I have a feeling, the quality of this stuff has become exceptionally low, even from brand names; you just don\'t know what to pick, everything is cheap, made in China, and dies in a couple of months.11/22/2012: Poster ""sreten"" says:> For an unlocked-PAL capable reading discs just buy Philips player at> Walmart.Thanks for the suggestion! I\'ll check it out.',)"

"('Let me preface this by saying that this review will be based on its relative performance in our office environment and its weight is based on workload and price. Ease of install is important and so is user connectivity/configuration.I\'m using this with a Juniper Netscreen-5GT that connects to a D Link DSS-24 (24 port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Switch). We are using it mostly for guests who come into our office wanting to check emails while they are conducting business meetings with us. We use a wired network for our work, but we want the conveniece of wireless for those people that don\'t want to hunt for an ethernet cable and a wall jack. I have done my testing mostly on Dell laptops with Intel Centrino processors. That said, I configured the AP at my desk before placing it in our wiring closet. I bought this access point last night, read a few reviews beforehand, and read the manual briefly before starting my work.I rate the ease of install as a 5, only because it wasn\'t complex and it didn\'t magically change IP addresses on me, even after I installed the firmware update.I rate it a 5 on use/reliability because we get very good to excellent strength anywhere in our office. 16 yards away in one direction is excellent and 24 yards in the other is very good. Note the latter travels through 3-4 walls. I was able to set the AP on top of our switch in the wiring closet close to the ceiling.Ease of Install was pretty high. That is, I performed the following to set it up:1. Unplugged my ethernet cable from my laptop and connected to the AP.2. Configured my laptop IP address similar to the owner manual\'s example (192.168.2.200).3. I can now log into the AP Setup and configure it.I noted the firmware = 3.00.10 and I had downloaded 4.03.03 (dated 10/2/2004  F5D7130_4.0.03.bin), so I ran the firmware update before configuring anything.4. After the AP\'s reboot, I changed the Setup\'s password, named the SSID, and enabled Security. That\'s it. In my case, the IP address never deviated from the user manual. This works for me.5. I restored my laptop\'s TCP/IP properties back to the way it was and plugged back into the network. I placed the AP into the closet and plugged it into the 24 port switch. That\'s it.Now, to get my laptop to use the wireless connection involved the following:1. Open my Intel wireless connection setup2. Scan for nearby wireless SSIDs3. Select my SSID and go through a wizard that asks for the type of security and my password.It was that simple. Now, I can\'t speak of others that are using Apples or are trying to use Belkin Pre-N to bridge to another system. I am not commenting/reviewing its bridging or extention features. I am only commenting on setting up and using . Since this is being used in a one-story medium-sized office and is primarly used for our visitors to check email or surf the net, we wanted something this would be reliable and inexpensive to implement. I found this for $39.99 at a local computer store, not a big chain. No rebates. very nice.The only ""confusing"" thing that occurred and is a low priority is that after the firmware update, the Hardware now says F5D7230, instead of F5D6130 in the Setup. Perhaps, that\'s a bug they introduced in this version of the firmware? I\'m not worried. It seems to work fine.',)"
"(""The bad news first.  It is discontinued.  The good news It is discontinued and you can pick this marvel up at a more than reasonable price.  I bought mine for under 200.00 brand new and with waranty.I won't bore you with photophile lingo and tech stuff there are others far more capable of such information who have already given their astute observations.  I will tell you the the clarity of this lens beats the Panasonic Lumix by a mile and I know that because I have one.I just got back from a week of shooting at Cape Cod through all kinds of weather conditions from bright sun reflected off of calm waters to dim foggy lit terrain and I am ecstatic with my portfolio.I have had the c-765 and it was just too small and then the 725 and it was too big with only an 8x zoom.  This camera size weight and layout were perfect.I am so pleased with the distance shots and the clarity of all the shots as well as the capability to capture visual nuance and light I am selling my lumix and buying another one of these while I can.Yes I know it only has 3 something image mp but 3. 2 or 9 with a razor sharp lense is worth all the other mega pixel cameras in the world. NO there is no photo stabilization but I know how to use a tripod and to steady a camera so I don't see it as a loss.  Stabilization is for the film maker in my mind and I am tired of people whining about not having it in every still camera.To me photograhy is about the light and the lens and now that I have hundreds of beautiful poetic or razor sharp images I know the brand and kind of digital camera I want ot use.I strongly suggest this camera and some basic photography lessons for those who can't get the shot right because then you will see what a gem this little beauty really is.From animal to seascape to haunted fields with fantastic depth of field or moody expressionism this camera gave me its all.Great lens, easy layout, uses rechargable aa batteries, full function for manual and cheap. My God what a bargain."",)"
"(""This is my second Olympus camera. First one was a C2500L. I still use that camera. I got the C750 because I didn't wait long enough for Olympus to come out with the C2100 with the 10x zoom when I bought the C2500L. So I've wanted a 10x zoom camera for 4 years. The other reasons I went with the C750 is because the hot shoe for the camera is identical to that of the C2500L and it has movie mode with audio.While I haven't used the camera for more than a day, it is very small compared to the C2500L. The camera comes with a tether for the lens cap that I found convenient. It takes amazing pictures with vivid color reproduction. The flash does not wash out the picture like my C2500L does. Illumination is more consistent throughout the shot than the C2500L. I would have liked the view finder to be optical instead of digital. But I am not going to complain since it automatically adjusts the focus and contrast fairly well for framing the shot. You can use the LCD to frame the shot and for recording movies. Very convenient.Movie mode is pretty cool and can be done with or without audio. Pictures can also be taken with or without audio, though the wav file is separate from the picture file when you copy it to the computer. The camera will look like a regular drive to the computer. I use Windows XP. No software needed. Just plug and go. I don't use the Camedia software so I can't comment on that. You can record movies and take pictures all on the xD picture card.Unlike my C2500L, it only takes xD picture cards. Contrary to my initial impression, it can delete all the images from the card all at once, without formating the card. The xD picture cards are so small, I don't mind having three types of cards for two cameras. My C2500L takes SmartMedia and Compact Flash. And the xD card is less than half the size of the SmartMedia at about the same thickness.The charger that comes with the camera is slow. Said to take 9 hours to charge the batteries. It recommends unplugging the charger after the 9 hours even if the batteries are not fully charged. I haven't looked into that very much but I just unplugged it after ten non-continuous hours of charging and the batteries got very warm but the light didn't shut off. Olympus included 1700 mAH batteries. I'm using 2000 mAH batteries in this camera. I've purposely taken over 100 stills at night with the flash, over 100 stills during the day and four 181 second movies and viewed it many many times with audio and I'm still on the same 2000 mAh batteries on its first charge. Incredible.I haven't been able to figure out how to get the camera to do fill flash photography. Don't know if it can.The quick start guide is handy for those in a rush. The basic manual is useless. The reference manual is what most will need and it's on the CD or can be had from the Olympus website, which is where I got it. Unless you shut off All Reset, the camera will keep dumping some of your personal settings every time you power cycle it. That annoyed me because it kept setting the quality to HQ after I had set it to SHQ.This camera is awesome. It's got lots of features that I've not had a chance to explore. More modes than I am used to with my C2500L. I recommend getting the fitted case for it. It should have been included with the camera but this is America where you get nickel and dimed. And plan on getting a larger capacity xD card. 16 MB just won't cut it.Update: Fill flash can be done. It was quite easy with the flash mode button. There are two annoying things about this camera. First off, wherever the camera is pointed, it will try to focus so that you can see what you're pointing the camera at through the viewfinder or LCD. The camera does NOT allow you to change the zoom while it's trying to focus. It's a pain in low light conditions and you're trying to quickly change the zoom to take a picture of the moment. You'll miss it by miles.The other annoying thing is that if you have a dark subject against a plain background, the camera will refuse to focus for the shot. I'll take a black pistol and put it on my bed with light blue covers to take a picture of it. The camera would focus so that the pistol will show up in the viewfinder. But when I tried to take the shot, it won't focus. My C2500L focused no problem. If I put a printed black and white document under the pistol, the camera focused no problem. I ended up taking the pictures with my old digital camera with the external FL-40 flash. I find this camera has inferior focusing capabilities to my C2500L. The C750 has a hard time focusing on a brass door knob on a brown door. No such problem with my C2500L. I took a star from the rating."",)"
"('I have read some of the other reviews about scroll wheel issues, but that is not the big problem with this mouse for most users.  I don\'t think most people use the scroll wheel anyway.But there is a big problem with this mouse.I just bought this a week ago and my first overwhelming impression is of how strange a design it is to have the main mouse button be thumb-operated as this mouse does.  It\'s still bothering me a week later.So that would be bad, but what is worse is that with this mouse thumb-operation is the ONLY option.  You cannot fix this or try different button arrangements using mouse settings!But the first reaction is I find it amazing that 3M wants me to now use my thumb to click when I\'ve been using my forefinger my entire life.  And when I\'m not using this mouse, I will still have to use my forefinger.  But they want me to get this thumb habit for some reason.  But if there were a benefit to the thumb click, it could be understood, but there seems no benefit.  The forefinger is the proper finger for clicking it seems to me; my forefinger just seems vastly better at clicking than my thumb, and inherently so.  And the thumb to me seems to bring a variety of issues, not just that one is not accustomed to it, but that it doesn\'t make any sense to try and get accustomed.So the thumb issue is the problem, but what is worse is that you can\'t get around it as you might think you ought to be able by simply swapping mouse buttons.  The right-click on the 3M mouse is also done with the thumb, and while Windows will let you swap right-click and left-click, it will not let you swap left-click with the scroll wheel button, which is all that large button (visible in the picture) that is on your non-thumb fingers does.  So before buying I thought I\'d have some flexibility about assigning buttons, but actually I have none.  You can make left-clicking be the the thumb, and you can make right-clicking be also the thumb on the upper side of the thumb button, or vice-versa (the thumb button is a rocker).  But you cannot get left or right-clicking off the thumb using the typical Windows control panel settings.  Of course it would make no sense to make the up-side of the rocker be regular clicking, since that is a much harder click, so this means you have no flexibility at all in assigning buttons with this mouse.So this seems the big downfall to me of this design.  If they had made the non-thumb button right-clicking, then you could swap these, which MIGHT help, but since they designed both clicks to be thumb operated, you can\'t even try that.Now you might reply, ""Well, my mouse control panel is super fancy and I can switch the middle-click with left click no problem!""  But you STILL will have a problem with this mouse.  The geniuses at 3M did not put the side button where your forefinger can easily get to it!  They put it where only your second and third fingers are positioned.  As a result, if you want to click with your forefinger, you\'re just out of luck, because you have just dead plastic under that finger.What I don\'t understand is why they didn\'t simply add a button to this thing, one where your forefinger goes, which interestingly they have a well-defined spot for.  Then they could keep that long button that they already have, for second and third fingers to use.  Seems it could have been so simple.  Just click with forefinger and right-click with one of the other fingers, just as you do with other mice.Yet I\'m not returning this (yet), though it cost over fifty dollars, because it does ease the wrist issue, my main purpose in buying this.  But for an expensive mouse, you would think you\'d get some button re-assignment options.  And this thumb thing may yet drive me absolutely over the edge and at some point in the future this mouse may end up in pieces, smashed on the floor from aggravation.  We\'ll see.  I\'ll try to check in after more time has passed...',)"

"(""When I started looking for a new camera to replace my DSC-S75, the first place I looked was Sony and I'm not sorry that I did.  I've owned Sony digital cameras for 5 years now and have never had any problems with any of the ones I've purchased (for me or my family).The V1 is a nice package... much more compact than the S75 and definitely the 707 or 717... but is much nicer to handle than any of their smaller Cybershot models.  It seems to have about as many features as the 717 .. except at a fraction of the cost.Now I'm not a professional photographer, and I fumble around with the controls .. not quite sure what everything does.... So the manual is an important feature for me. This one is well written and answers questions quickly.Picture quality is superb!  Instead of having the sizes set to 640x480 .. 1280x960 .. or any other combination.. the V1 uses the  megapixel ratings to let you know the size.. ie:  VGA, 1.2M, 3.1M, 5M, etc .. It really lets you know the size your images are going to be when you download them onto your computer.The nightframing &amp; nightshot features are very cool!  You can take a picture .. in pitch black.. and it come out with excellent .. true to life color.The *only* thing that I have a problem with, is the power saving feature.  Once the flash fires, the LDC screen turns off and it 'powers down' for about 30 seconds while the flash recoups.  It comes back on, but that's precious picture taking time that you can't capture!  The S75 has a much better recovery time after the flash fires.  Sony needs to work on that one!  I would usually leave the red eye reduction on, and be able to shoot anytime w/ my flash as a fill... but now that's not such a great idea.  Guess I'll have to buy a flash for the hotshoe and hope that's not an issue there.Ok, so there's two issues.. Where the popup flash is located.  It really is not ideally situated .. as it's right where your finger would be on holding the camera. It's no biggie to retrain yourself to hold the camera different.. it's just gonna take a bit getting use to.All in all, I would recommend this camera.  The pictures are great!  The zoom is fantastic!  The color is true to life!  And the price is reasonable."",)"
"(""My last digital camera was a Canon Powershot S100. It was the 2.11 megapixel version. My experience was so positive, that I upgraded to the S400 after 3 years of solid service from my first S100.You can't find a more useful, quality camera at any price. It's powerful, yet very small and light. The hipness factor is alse very high. People love to ogle it. Camera envy!I carry it in my jacket pocket ot attache wherever I go. That's a huge plus on my scorecard. I also have a small camera case from Wal-Mart I bought for $5, just in case I think I need a little more protection for it (like when traveling, or outside a lot). I can wear it on my belt, yet it is well padded, and can carry spare memory cards and an extra battery.The S400 takes 4 megapixel shots. Using an Epson Stylus Photo RX500 (multifunction device: printer/scanner/copier), I printed 4x6 photos and 8.5 x 11 photos. To my eye, both were photo lab quality when printed on premium glossy stock. I used Canon paper for 4 x 6, and HP paper for 8.5 x 11. I believe that the premium glossy photo paper from all the major manufacturers is excellent. Shop price, rather than feeling you are forced to go with the same brand as your printer. I print about 30 4x6 photos for every 1 full page photo.I set my S400 at the highest resolution and the next-to-highest quality. That way, I get all the pixels, yet there is adequate compression. This keeps the files manageable, and you can fit more photos on a memory card. I use a 256MB card, with a 128MB spare. At current prices, everyone can afford to have more memory handy.Not being a camera bug or serious photo hobbyist, I use all the automatic settings I can. Auto focus, auto white level, auto exposure. When it needs a flash, it flashes. The only time I make any adjustments is when I am in sunny conditions or I am close to an object I am shooting (macro).Generally, I just point and shoot, and it is a thing of beauty. Semi-pro camera gurus can probably make this thing take even better shots.Battery life is fine, with the new Lithium-ion cell. It's better than the one that came with the S100. The wall charger they give you is also tiny, and charges it quickly. Die-hards might want an extra charged battery when they are going to take a lot of shots in a short period of time, or when the flash will be used on every shot. I have  never run out of battery juice while in the middle of taking shots. But I don't take 150+ shots without a chance to charge it back up.The 3X optical zoom is better than the old 2X from past models. I disable the optical zoom, so my image stays in native full resolution.I rarely use the video mode, because I have a newer Sony mini-DV camcorder that is incredible for video.It's best to stick with the strengths of each device. Camera: photos. Camcorder: video. The video quality on the S400 is poor, and the digital photo quality on the Sony camcorder is poor. If I can only take one of these with me, the S400 almost always wins. While the Sony camcorder is small and light, it is still about 5x the size and weight of the Canon S400. Convenience often carries the day.I never use the USB connection to connect the camera directly to the computer. I have a 6-in-1 card reader for my computer, and my printer is compatible with all memory types. It's nice to know the direct connection is there if I need it, though.You can't go wrong with the S400. Prices are even starting to come down, as 5 megapixel cameras are coming out. I'm sure Canon has a 5 megapixel Elph in the works, but for high-quality photos up to 8.5x11, it's hard to improve on the S400."",)"
"('Back in 2003 the 10D was hot stuff, only one step below the 1D and 1Ds; as of 2011 most of its value has depreciated away, and consequently it\'s very cheap on the used market. I bought one for 75, which feels wrong, but I\'m not complaining. I actually got hold of it it so that I could have it converted into an infrared camera, and it\'s a popular base for conversion because it\'s cheap and fairly robust, with a metal body and decent shutter life. Unfortunately it was released just before Canon launched the EF-S range, and so you can\'t easily mount EF-S lenses unless you\'re prepared to modify them. This limits your choice of ultra-wide lenses, although as far as I know ultrawides from Sigma and Tamron and so forth will work fine. If you have a Canon 10-22mm you might want to look at a second-hand 350D instead. (I would avoid the 300D; it\'s slow, not much smaller than the 10D, the firmware is less functional, it\'s apparently less robust, and a lot of them were thrashed by their owners).Good stuff: In typical Canon style the interface and general operation are mostly sensible and there aren\'t any obvious quirks, apart from the overcomplicated custom white balance procedure. The body feels tough, and the battery grip is available fairly cheaply (it also fits the D30 and D60). ISO 100-400 are still fine by modern standards, ISO 800 is okay, ISO 1600 decent at a pinch, ISO 3200 not so much. There\'s nothing wrong with the colours. It takes ordinary compact flash cards - there isn\'t a 2gb limit - and Canon\'s then-standard BP-511 batteries, which are still available on eBay and so forth. Autofocus is much better than the earlier D30/D60 and is again fine by modern consumer standards, although it\'s not a 1D. 6mp is plenty for most purposes. It uses standard E-TTL (the top professional flash at the time was the 550EX). The grip rubber remains intact, unlike e.g. the grip rubber on the Nikon D1x.Good or bad stuff: The feature set is extremely spartan, reminiscent of the original 5D (although instead of using picture styles it has simple colour / contrast profiles). It doesn\'t have face-detect autofocus, an electronic spirit level, live view, a movie mode, in-camera panoramas, in-camera HDR, GPS, built-in wireless flash control, none of that. It just takes pictures.Bad stuff: It\'s slow. You get used to it, but compared to a modern camera it\'s like using an old PowerMac G3. If you\'re shooting a fast-moving sports event you\'ll learn to curse the BUSY display on the monitor, during which you can\'t review your images. Flicking through the images on the card is a frustrating process, and it even takes a second or so to generate the histogram. It gets worse if you plan on transferring the images from the camera to your computer with a USB cable - I did this on holiday once, trying to save space in my bag by not packing a card reader - because it takes a minute or more to transfer a single image. You can scroll around images on the tiny LCD screen, but this uses the wheel and a ""left-right, up-down"" toggle that\'s not much fun. The 20D introduced a little joystick.In fact the 20D is the better camera. A year or so ago the 20D still fetched a decent price on eBay, although recently it seems to have crashed down to 30 or so more than the 10D. Perhaps people are offloading their old camera gear in light of the economic downturn; digital SLRs were one of the big luxury boom items during the boom times, people took out loans to buy them so they could take holiday snapshots. Still, I digress. If you can afford the extra, by all means get a 20D instead.In general the 10D is still a solid, decent camera that\'s as good as it was back in 2003; my 5D MkII produces much larger files, but the colours, contrast aren\'t obviously different at lower ISOs. It suffers from the same problem as Nikon\'s D50, D70 etc, in that subsequent cameras added features without reducing the image quality, and so the 10D ends up the least-best choice rather than the most-worst, if you see what I mean.',)"
"('I got this device about two months ago, and up until tonight, it performed admirably. Setup was easy, I got my internet connection up and running in about 5 minutes, and got all my wireless security settings up and running in another 15.Up until now, it has performed well. However, its failure tonight and subsequent wading through Netgear\'s technical support offerings turned me off of this product forever.I was playing World of Warcraft, and after about an hour, my connection abruptly died altogether. No internet, I could not even access the router\'s internal setup page to check on its status. It seemed to be in some sort of hard-locked state. Rebooting it didn\'t improve things.I broke out the CD that came with the device, with the idea of looking at the manual (they don\'t give you a paper copy, it\'s all on the CD). Pretty basic stuff, checking connections, etc. The troubleshooting section was full of hints on how to make sure that it isn\'t a problem with another component in your system before daring to blame theirs. I have a more surefire method. My old trusty Linksys Etherfast cable/dsl router had no trouble getting me back online.So I went to netgear\'s website to download the latest firmware.With the firmware image ready, my next task was to get the Netgear device back up and running so I could access its setup page. I discovered that if I disconnected the WAN cable going to my cable modem, the device would actually stay in a usable state. If I connect the WAN cable, it seems to die within about 15 seconds. Ordinarily I\'d suspect something to be wrong with my cable modem here, but my Linksys router has no trouble with it as I have been online problem-free for over an hour using it now, as I\'m writing this review.Anyway, I got the thing to boot, and loaded the new firmware image on it, then restarted the router. I hit the setup page again, only to discover it has been replaced by a ""wizard"". The wizard was unable to get an address via DHCP, and so guessed that I use a static IP. Or at least, that is what I am imagining happened as it displayed ""we are now detecting your internet connection settings"" for several moments and then announced that I needed to enter static IP information.The thing that most galled me about this is that they don\'t provide a way to say ""no, that\'s not correct. I use DHCP. And where the hell are the rest of the menus I used to use?"" I discovered you can get to these if you forge static IP settings and tell it to continue. On the failure page that results, you can find a link that takes you to the ""basic settings"" section, which is essentially the menu system the old firmware used to set up the router.The summary of this complaint is this: the device and its associated software go to great lengths to make setup easy, and to minimize the steps necessary to get things running, *if everything is working.* I imagine many customers can just breeze through the wizard and get themselves online. However, if something goes wrong, the ""wizard"" is useless. For one thing, almost all of the technical support documentation\'s suggestions are impossible to carry out without fighting your way past the wizard into the normal configuration.So for now I\'m back on my trusty Linksys, without wireless support, but given the reliability I\'ve experienced between the two brands, I\'m going to buy a Linksys wireless router instead.',)"
"('UPDATE of previous review.I now have had this router for almost a year now. I have not experienced any problems described by others stating that the Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router needs to be restarted every week (or more). Though I have had to reset the router 2-3 times in its lifetime, the error was due to the failure of my cable broadband modem (and its restart) that required me to restart my wireless router. I had a feeling that I probably did not need to restart the Netgear wireless router, but did anyway without testing if it did not need to be restarted.I still have the problem of having to broadcast the SSID when I needed to add several newly purchased computers onto the wireless network (which I previously described as a problem). Another problem that I noticed was that when I added my father-in-law\'s notebook to the list, the router seemed to be confused and would only allow one computer at a time to connect to the router. I never experienced this problem with all of my computers (all 8 computers wirelessly connected to this router). I was never able to troubleshoot this problem, since he now has a wireless broadband connection (Verizon, which is excellent, but an extra $60/month) and no longer needs to use my wireless router.Another new problem is that for some reason the distance has now decreased. A year ago, I was able to have a ""Good/Very Good"" connection in the master bedroom, which is upstairs and at the other end of the house where the router is located. Now, I have ""Poor"" or no connection. I cannot pinpoint any obvious differences between now and then. I had to break out my old Netgear 802.11b router (MR814)for wireless connection upstairs, which is compatible with the WGR614 router. When I connect a Linksys compact wireless router (WRT54GC) with a high-gain antenna (HGA7S) with the same laptop (as control), I have nearly a full signal in the master bedroom, so it is possible to get excellent signal. If Netgear can provide an optional high-gain antenna for this router to improve the signal, i would definitely rate this router 5 stars!!!Also, Netgear wireless routers is still incompatible with other (products\') routers, both wired and wireless. I tried to use a Linksys 802.11g router for the upstairs, but killed all network connections (both wired and wireless) when I linked up to the WGR614. Neither the WGR614 (802.11g) or the MR814 (802.11b) operates with a Linksys BEFSR41 wired router, but they work quite well with the Netgear FS608 wired switch. This is something Netgear (and maybe also Linksys) has to address.For PROs and CONs, I will stick with my original list, which I included at the bottom of this review.Conclusion:This wireless router is decent, and has obvious places for improvement. I give it 4 stars only because it works as a ""GOOD"" stand-alone wireless router for a small-to-average size place. I would give it 3 stars if I had to include its incompatibility with other products (ie. non-Netgear), and for its decrease in functionality/signal over longer distances and through several walls/barriers.I plan to copy this review and send it to both Netgear and Linksys, so that maybe they can address the issues I\'ve posted.*** OLD REVIEW ***Prior to this purchase, I had the wireless-b version (Netgear MR814), which worked decently, when in the same room or an adjacent room. I decided to upgrade to a wireless-g router (Netgear WGR614) for three reasons: 1) To double firewall security (NAT firewall PLUS SPI firewall) compared to MR814, 2) To increase wireless range, and 3) To increase speed/rate of computer-to-computer file transfer.Setup: The setup was relatively easy. I bypassed the setup wizard, and configured the router manually. After troubleshooting some hiccups (WGR614 is not compatible with Linksys BEFSR41 router), my working setup is that the WGR614 is directly linked to my cable broadband modem, and my MR814 uplinked to the WGR614. Overall, the setup time was about 10-12 minutes.For some reason, I have to enable the broadcast of the SSID in order for my computers to find the router. I tried to force my computers to find the router manually, but failed. This is no big deal because I also secured the router by limiting the MAC addresses who can see this router, so I can specify which wireless cards (my computers) can access the router. Login to the router is different (http address), but still works the same as previous router.Speed and Distance: There is no noticeable difference with regards to web browsing. This is not surprising, because the maximum download speed of most internet broadband providers are somewhere between 1.5-3.0 Mbps (DSL) to 4-6 Mbps (Cable). Notice I say ""maximum,"" because the working speed is actually 60-70% of their boasted speeds. I have Comcast Cable Broadband, and although they say the download speeds are upwards of 6-8 Mbps, I have only ""clocked"" their speed (via Mcafee speedometer) at an average of 1.5-2 Mbps, and peaked at about 3 Mbps a few times.I\'ve had the occasional signal drop with my HP Pavilion notebook (using the Netgear WG511 wireless-g card), but I\'m not sure if it is the router or my wireless card who is at fault. I have a feeling it is on the wireless card end, because my HP Notebook workstation AND my Dell Latitude X1 have no problems with signal drop or range.It worked so well that I helped my neighbor setup the same router, but we went through the wizard, and setup went by without a glitch. He only had one laptop to setup wireless, so that made it easier.Pros:-Easy setup.-Looks clean.-Works great.-I like the ""feet"" that can be attached to this router so that it can stand.Cons:-Not possible (without modifications) to mount on a wall. MR814 are wall-mountable.-This router seems to be only compatible withNetgear hardware. I have a wired Linksys router (BEFSR41), which was compatible with the MR814, but not compatible with the WGR614. (I gave my Linksys router to my sister.) This is the only reason I dropped it down to a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating.',)"
"(""This is an exceptional router and at this price you can't find a better choice. I see a lot of disgruntled people here who can't connect to the router wirelessly after changing settings. I would like to give a couple of tips. First of all, make sure you configure the router when you are hard wired. You have to ensure that you are connected to the router via a LAN cable whenever you are making any changes to the router's configuration. This way when the router restarts etc. you will still be connected to it. If you are carrying out any changes to the router through your wireless card, for example if you have changed the WEP encryption code in the router, then once you submit those changes, the router will not let your wireless card connect until your laptop's card is configured for the same WEP key. So once again, please ensure you carry out changes to the router only when hard wired. The moment you get your router, I suggest you carry out a firmware upgrade (go to netgear's support site and download the latest firmware for your model from there). Once again follow instructions and make sure you are connected through a cable to carry out the same. Now log onto the router and then do a couple of things.First of all, rename the SSID to anything you want (eg. Joan's Arc). Then go to the wireless settings, then to wireless access, and click on 'Disable SSID broadcast'. This ensures that the SSID is not broadcast to others around you who have a wireless machine. So when their software searches for a wireless access point all they will see is a blank name. To be able to connect to your network they would have to know the name of your SSID (Joan's Arc in this case) and manually type it in their machines (Highly unlikely that they will be able to think of the same name as you do. You can make your name even harder to obtain by simply using numeric characters in it.. for example Joan's Arc2004). Secondly, to make it secure use a 128 bit WEP key (this has to be a 26 digit key consisting of alphanumeric and numeric characters. You can use only certain alphabets in small and large case so you need to check that out. Also remember that you have to feed the same WEP key number in your laptop wireless card software (or the windows wireless settings if you are not using your wireless card's software). Finally you can ensure that only the wireless devices you specify can logon to your router. Go to the Wireless settings, then to wireless access setup and then click on 'enable wireless access'... Thereafter click on 'Setup access list'. Once there add your wireless device by using its mac address (the mac address is a unique number given to a wireless device, very much like a phone number- this enables the router to identify the device trying to connect to it). The mac address will be listed on your wireless device and you can also see all the devices that you can allow to connect to your router in the router's configuration window. (One important note to remember is that if you have already enabled WEP then you will have to first feed in the same key into your wireless device software settings before the router will display it in it's list of devices). Select the device that you want to allow to connect to your router and apply.Hope this helps to a certain extent to configure your routers. Trust me, this is an amazing router and if you are having connection problems, it most likely is due to the settings in the router- not because the router is faulty."",)"

"('I just recently move from dial up to DSL. I should have done this years ago and with 2 in college, 5 computers in the house the time had finally come. Going DSL was not enough; I did not want to have cables running though the house so I started looking into going wireless. To make a long story short, after a little investigation I decided to make the leap into wireless technology. I purchased the WAP55AG router and the adapter cards, WMP55AG and WPC55AG.I use the Nortel Network software to VPN into work and do not have any problems.I had no difficulty setting up the hardware and software and with a few hours, I was on the net. All of my computers run Windows XP, both Home and Professional versions. The Web Interface into the router is simple and easy to use.The LinkSys Web site has all the documentation you need for installation and setup. There is a ""Knowledge Base"" page that covers a lot of the products and answers to a lot of questions about various products and configurations; I found it to be very helpful.Pulled from LinkSys Web Site:----------------------------------------The Dual-Band Wireless A+G Access Point actually contains two separate wireless connectivity radio transceivers, which support all three popular wireless networking specifications. The first transceiver uses the 2.4GHz radio band, supporting both the widely-used and inexpensive Wireless-B (802.11b) standard at 11Mbps, and the new, almost five times faster, Wireless-G (draft 802.11g) at 54Mbps. The second radio operates in the 5GHz band, and supports Wireless-A (802.11a) networking, also at 54Mbps. Since the two radios operate in different bands, they can work simultaneously, blanketing your wireless zone with high-speed bandwidth.Dual-band, tri-standard Access Point communicates with Wireless-A (802.11a), Wireless-B (802.11b), and Wireless-G (draft 802.11g) wireless networksProtect your wireless investment while preparing your infrastructure for the futureAdvanced features: SNMP manageability, and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)Powerful security: Up to 152-bit wireless data encryption (WEP), and wireless MAC address filterFeatures of the product:--------------------------------MAC Addressing Filtering and up to 152-bit WEP EncryptionBuilt in Web User Interface for easy configuration from any browserFirmware upgradeable through Web browserFree Technical support 24/73 Year Limited WarrantySystem Requirements (Minimum):---------------------------------------------One Pentium PC (200 MHz or Faster)64 MB RAMInternet Explorer 4.0 or Netscape Navigator or Higher for Web-based ConfigurationCD-ROM Drive802.11a, 802.11b, or draft 802.11g Wireless Adapter with TCP/IP Protocol Installed',)"

"(""Having purchased the Sangean DT-110, 120, 180 and the 200VX as well as the Sony SRF-37V and SRF-M97 (as well as several Kaito radios, including the KA11, KA1102, etc.), I can readily say that the Panasonic RF-SW50S is the best radio to use for listening in the close proximity of computing and related RF (Radio frequency) noise generating equipment. Please see my many other very detailed reviews on these other radios. The Panasonic is very ruggedly made and has a very nice display (no clock or automatic turnoff however) with battery status (even if it is turned off by simply pressing preset button #3 and of course while it is turned on) and a lock switch status indicated when it is on or off too as well as 20 individual presets (10 total on am and 10 total on fm chosen in two user selectable operating modes, i,e, mode1 and mode2), etc. The RF-SW50S is only a little larger than the Sangean and Sony units too so that it still just fits the nice, inexpensive hard shell, HS-5, Digital Tech concepts case that I bought from Sears (this product can also be viewed at Sakar International). In addition, I really like the very high quality of the sound of the Panasonic shock wave radio (it also comes with a deep bass boost switch) and the useful DX/local FM sensing switch (with standard city interference or normal DX settings).I also think the am reception is excellent and strong (I hear Denver from here easily at night). This is equally true of the fm stations, both inside and outside of buildings contrary to some other reviews. The Sangean DT-110 is the next best radio to use near computing machinery, but its fm reception is better than its am/mw reception probably because of its very small size. The presets on the RF-SW50S are very easy to set and chosen with a single key press just like on the SRF-37V.You should definitely plan on using or purchasing a different set of earphones as the supplied unit is not very useful as well as uncomfortable and inflexible. I also strongly prefer open air headphones and not earbud style earphones for personal safety if listening while walking in a crowded area.Tuning on the Panasonic is a little clunky compared especially to the Sangean DT-110 with its manual or automatic scan and seek capabilities, but it is nevertheless still very usable with a single switch type button to either be pressed and held to choose the operating mode or also using a separate rotating motion (either clockwise or counterclockwise) for am/fm station tuning (see also below for more details). The one drawback I can see with this arrangement is the constant beeping noise during the tuning of the radio. Tuning can only be accomplished by either directly rotating the mode/tuning button and holding it toward a clockwise or ccw direction (and indicated in the directions as +/-) to advance frequencies semi-automatically or by using a single button rotation at a time in order to advance or retreat by one small step in frequency. By the way, just for the record this tuning operation is far harder to explain than it actually is to perform! Also, from other reviews it seems advisable to purchase an extended warranty too, since it only has a one year warranty (Please read other Amazon reviews on this issue so that you won't be disappointed prematurely if its just stops working). Also, my unit did not come with the 4 Panasonic AAA batteries as advertised by Amazon and others and clearly stated in the enclosed manual for the RF-SW50 radio, so maybe Panasonic just stopped including batteries with the newer RF-SW50S?. My supplier on Amazon, Ace Photodigital in NYC, just to make things even however, very quickly mailed out a package of 4 energizer AAA batteries to me through the US Post office. Panasonic claims 25-26 hours of listening time on a single AAA battery, which I have yet to verify, but based on other similar radios that I have tested it seems quit reasonable, with a little longer operating time expected on am compared with fm for example. It is now very ironic to me after much time and effort that the least expensive priced unit of all the pocket radios available on Amazon also gets the best reception close to computers, monitors, electric lighting and motors, etc. Now, who would have thought of that in advance?"",)"

"('My main speakers go down to honest 30hz (NHT classic four).  So I thought I\'d give my frequency response a bump in the 20-35hz region.  This sub can\'t play a frequency it\'s asked to play, and it\'s the slowest sub I\'ve ever heard (it takes a second for it to ""warm up"" to a frequency, and another second for the sub to stop resonating - I\'m exaggerating, but NOT REALLY).  For most people with a crossover of 80hz-120hz, this sub will basically ruin fast jazzy contrabass lines, it won\'t even sound like a double bass.  I was ok with this, music below 30hz, rarely demands speed (and my mains were taking care of the speed, and most bass anyway), I just want the rumble.  But, to top it off, it plays 2nd harmonic LOUDER than the base frequency below 30hz (that\'s one octave up). There are some Bjork pieces in which bass (just about pure sine) goes well into 20hz region, and this guy just plays one octave up.  It sounds alright musically, but I don\'t need my subwoofer to make musical decisions for me and transpose my music to whatever octave it decides to play :)  I prefer my subs to just give up and roll off gently if they can\'t do it; but this is UNACCEPTABLE.  I had to get my signal generator to confirm this and do a 20hz-200hz sweep, because I couldn\'t figure out why everything sounded ""off"".  I\'ve had other subs in the exact same room and location, and none of them did this.  I had a special case where I crossed it very low, so my set up brought up the worst in this sub, it\'ll sound ok with a usual xo of 60-120hz.If you need something for explosions, it\'s alright; it sure produces the volume that my main speakers can\'t.  If you just want ""bump"" in your music, it\'s ok.  If you want this sub to actually play your music - LOOK ELSEWHERE.This sub can only be described as sloppy, you\'ll never hear a tight bass-drum coming out of this, just the sloppy rumble with boomy thump with an audible attack delay; even if you cross it at 150hz.  You\'ll get 300W-RMS of ""this"" though :), I don\'t know how polk decided to put its name on this monstrosity, and I\'m totally not surprised about ridiculously low prices that these go for these days, and the only reason they fetch even that much is because of the polk name.  This sub sounds like a DYI project that doesn\'t sound quite right and needs more tuning.  And I had to get a signal generator and an oscilloscope to find out what it was doing.  Simple answer - just forget it.  I haven\'t tried other subs in 200 dollar range.  I\'ve had ""legacy audio"", ""m&k;"" and ""velodyne"" subs before, so perhaps I\'ve been spoiled.',)"
"('I own a condo, so held off at first on this sub reading about its power spilling to the floors/walls/fixtures & neighbors. After further research I learned about the importance of a subdude. Auralex sells them on Amazon, and it\'s worth every penny to really maximize the brilliant performance (for anything in its price range) of the Polk PSW 505. Of the very few negative reviews I\'ve seen for the PSW505, things like ""sloppy"", not ""tight"", those who don\'t enjoy having the foundation of their home rattle - the subdude eliminates all of that.I received my PSW505 last night and hooked it up through the LFE connection from my receiver. Crossover set to 80, which is used with Polk TSI 400s as fronts, Polk T15s as rears, and for now (due to size constraints) a small yet surprisingly effective & crisp BIC center channel.I then propped it ontop of my subdude and began testing it out. At low to moderate volumes (which I won\'t go beyond until the break in ends - approx 30 hrs per Polk tech support), thanks to the subdude, there are no vibrations in the walls, floor, handing picures, lamps. Some may think this detracts bass. Not true, it just removes the fake/artificial noise side effects of a subwoofer\'s sound not being isolated. The quality of the bass coming from the woofer becomes that much more tight, that more more potent, so the bass is concentrated from the woofer, through the air, to my ears & body. That\'s my kind of bass. I can also enjoy decent volume without having neighbors tempted to call the police. I\'m sure if I continue bumping up the volume on this beast, even with the subdude, neighbors will begin to notice.With the above mentioned settings, all of my other speakers set to ""small"" (even my rather large tower fronts), the sound is rich & thick for music. Although my TSIs can go down to 44 hz ""effectively"" and even down to 34, the ""umph"" of anything under 80 is richer and fuller on the PSW505. This also frees up my TSI 400\'s to pump out more efficient upper & mid range, so overall the sound is so much better with the crossover at 80.After a couple of hours of fiddling with placement (the corner worked best for me), settings, etc while listening to music, I watched an episode of Breaking Bad through my Roku streamer which streams Dolby Digital Plus. This is when the 300 continuous watts (for music) can boost up to 460 watts. Wow...that\'s all I can say. And this is just out of the box without break in.I\'m looking forward to seeing how much better this can get with break in, and if I remember will post a follow-up review in about a month.Best $200 I\'ve spent in a long time. I don\'t think there\'s anything close to this value. BIC F12 is one that comes closest, but of all the reviews it sounds like this Polk gets the nod due to it being better in music and more powerful with watts. I\'ve also read about the BIC rattling at louder volumes, with the Polk\'s construction being a bit more solid. If you go to a place like Best Buy, you\'ll see 8"" and 10"" subs, much weaker & smaller, for $200 and up.I highly recommend this sub, unless you are an audiophile with ears that can hear a difference, you really won\'t hear much difference until going to the $1,000 and up subs.Get this before it\'s no longer available. It is discontinued so won\'t be around forever, and used to sell for over $400 a few years ago (originally was over $500). And please get a subdude to hear the highest quality sound that is intended, unless you enjoy the rattling walls/floor effect and don\'t care as much about the bass being as tight as possible.Update 7/18:Two minor damages in shipping which Polk customer service is sending replacements for:1) Like many have noted, the cloth cover2) The gasket surrounding the woofer. As I ran my finger across inspecting it, one corner wasn\'t firmly in place & wouldn\'t get pressed back in. Not even visibly noticeable & the purpose of the gasket is purely cosmetic. But if you are picky like me & notice the same issue, Polk has gaskets they can send out.With my fronts being Polk TSI 400 with decent bass down to 44 hz, then some bass even down to 34, for 2.1 stereo mode when listening to music I prefer a crossover of 60. 80 as crossover still works best for surround since my tiny bic only goes down to 75. I just ordered a Polk C20 due to the low sale price of 170, and will see how a 60 crossover sounds with that since bass goes down to 58 efficiently. My opinion is set the crossover as low as your other speakers can handle. Tiny, weak speakers needing a high crossover over 100 hz may not give the tightest bass although this sub efficiently goes to 125 hz. Reviews I have read, and what I am hearing, indicate this sub shines with 80 crossover & below if your other speakers can handle it.I am being cautious with break in leaving volume at 25%, but did bump to 50 for a few minutes to tease myself. Wow...probably too much, so a volume gain of about 1/3 may be perfect for my taste. My condo living room is small, about 15x14; however it is in an open floorplan with my dining room & entrance hall not separated from lr with walls. Very happy still, the minor shipping dings worth it, especially since Polk CS made the process of sending replacements so easy.Update 8/4:Break in period complete, so I have increased the volume gain to 50%, and the receiver individual sub volume at 0 db (half way since range is -10 to +10). Bass really thumps at these levels, even when master volume from receiver is low. The most I have pushed this out of curiosity was leaving sub volume gain at 50%, bumping sub volume from receiver up to +7db, and turning master volume up to about 40% (at -40 db, with range going from  -80 to +16). Ridiculously intense bass...with the subdude, and having carpeted floors on top of concrete, I could still feel the floor vibrating at this level. It\'s almost scary to think what would happen if I took the subdude away, bumped sub volume gain up to about 90% (which I have read is the most you should go before hearing distortion), maxed out the receiver sub volume & turned the master volume up to 50% or more...I am fully convinced this sub is overkill for my needs, but works perfectly when I tone down the settings & utilize the subdude.',)"
"('1) CORD a:  Yes, the cord on one side is longer than the other so that you can either put the cord behind your neck or let it hang under your chin.  This is a feature.  If you don\'t think you\'ll like this design, then these headphones may not be for you.  I do wish it was just a tad longer however.  An additional couple of inches would help when wearing thicker clothing.2) CORD b:  These headphones are short-cord style headphones, with an extension cord.  The short-cord style is ideal for many current portables that come with a wired remote so that you don\'t have an extra 6-10 inches of tangled cord.  For those who don\'t need it to be short, the extension should give you plenty of extra length.3) EARBUDS & COMFORT:  The earbuds are made of silicon and the degree of comfort may differ for everyone.  Personally, these are significantly more comfortable than *ANY* in-ear headphones I have ever worn.  I have not however, tried the Shure or Etymotic\'s, but then again, I\'m not reviewing $120 headphones.  Also, some of you may not like how far down the ear you have to insert these.  It practically sits in your ear canal.  I don\'t mind however.  My only complaint about the silicon buds is that it picks up a lot of particles, from your ears or just dust sitting on the desk.  Might want to give them a good wipe with a wet paper towel now and then.4) SOUND:  The frequency response specs on these are pretty impressive.  Hooked into my MP3 player or MiniDisc player, I am pleased with the sound quality, which is mostly rock-based, pop, and some trance.  The bass is very very good.  So good, that I turned the bass boost on my MD down.  I usually have to compensate for poor bass, but with the MDR-EX71SL\'s, not so.5) ACCESSORIES:  The MDR-EX71SL comes with 3 different sized earbuds, a 3 foot extension cord, a plastic case for the headphones, and another piece of plastic which I think is supposed to enclose the headphones or help wind the length of the cord(not sure yet).6) MISC:  I read one reviewer mention, ""South Korean-made, Sony badged"" and I\'m not sure what that has anything to do with it.  Sony hasn\'t made their products in Japan for a long time, less some of their higher end equipment.  These are not rebadged headphones.SUMMARY:If the features of these headphones appeal to you, I am confident that you will be satisfied, or even very happy with them.  And it\'s hard to beat Amazon.com\'s price.  I have a fairly discerning ear and I like them very much.  I also own Grado\'s and Koss Pro headphones.  If you can afford to pay 4 times more for headphones, then it\'s likely you will enjoy the Shure\'s or Etymotic\'s, but I for one would rather save the money.  If you\'re like me, then I think the MDR-EX71SL\'s are worth a listen.  If ultimate sound quality is your objective and price is no barrier, you might be happier with the higher end cans like the Etymotic\'s.',)"

"(""Okay. Here is a write up, that I did, on the comparisons/contrasts on MP3 players. Mainly, the Harddrive versions (I.E. Rio Riot/Apple IPOD -both of which I own) and the flash memory type... (I.E. Memorex 3642 Mp3 Player, of which I own as well).What prompted this little jaunt (of which you may send to as many people as you like) My (expensive) Apple IPOD died during a sync last month. Just me copying files over to it, and the battery ran out of juice. I would have not attempted to copy music had I known the battery was low, but the battery read FULL STRENGTH. Anyhoo, I called Apple, they said return it for maintenance.I did. Sent it back.They returned it, still broke.To my suprise, there is only a TEN DAY return policy.TEN DAYS.I did not realize this at all... and will not ever buy another apple product.So, after a month or so of messing around trying to find another MP3 player... I decided to go with a flash memory MP3 player, the ones that use memory sticks.SO, here are the pro and cons of these devices.Pro's for the Memory Stick Mp3 players-Cheaper. WAY CHEAPER than Hard drive types.-If you go into music match and file convert to MP3 Pro and shrink the size of your MP3 to like, say 3o percent... you can really make a good Kompression. Example. My Memorex MP3 player has 32mbs of memory on board. It is expandable to 256mb. 32 mb will basically let you put one cd's worth of music. It is easy to put music on and off of them, due to your computer reading the USB as just another hard drive, so you drag and drop to put on, delete them to take them off. But, after you shrink your files to MP3 Pro 30 percent, you can put twice as many. So, basically a 256mb chip will allow me to put 208 songs on my little less than palm size MP3 player. And it wieghs like 3 ounces.- More on memory. These little chips are the size of the upper part of your thumb, at least my thumb anyway. They come in 128mb, 256mb, 512mb and even though there aren't any MP3 machines out there to handle them YET, you can even buy a 1.5gig thumb size chip thingy. Considering the size of the chips and the shrinking kompression I told you about earlier, I could shrink my whole KOLLEKTION down to 10 of those 1.5gig chips. At the current shrink rate I am at 5 DVD's, which are way bigger and more fragile than these little chips.- Not as fragile as hard drive type. You can drop one of these chips and not scratch it. I wouldn't stomp on one with my foot, nor get one in water, but they are encased in plastic. Ruggedish.- Batteries last for like two days. There isn't much going on here, no moving parts, no laser or hard drive to put power to. Most of these flash Memory types have a single AA battery. I use a rechargeable type, so we are talking very low cost here.In comparison to the hard drive types, where you will get a solid 8 hours of playing, this really whupps up.- Size. Small. Very small. Mine is three inches by three inches. A square. But, you can get smaller ones. And the memory chips that go in them are the same ones you use for your camera. And you can put files on them. If you want to put a word doc on your memory chip, you can. Your Mp3 won't recognize it, but it is nifty storage.COMPARISON/CONTRAST- Size does matter. In the case of hard drive Mp3 players... lets face it, you can, if you so chose to, put a library of congress on these monsters. They are the caddilacs of the hand held devices, and guzzle batteries like gasoline. But when it comes down to it, size is the only thing they have going for them. I don't mean to downplay the hard drive types, but don't drop them, don't shake them, and after shelling out $499 to Apple you might consider insurance. Apple doesn't care about you or your apple after 10 days of ownership.- Price/Komparison. IPOD ran me $499 bucks. My memorex MP3 player ran me 45 dollars. The 128 memory chip runs you 50 bucks. Owch. There really isn't a comparison to the two. The memory stick Mp3 players just kick butt on this issue. And, you get MORE than a ten day return policy, since you buy these things at Target/Wal Mart etc...So, that is my review in a nutshell"",)"
"('I\'ve been using Kensington trackballs since 1993, and have never looked back.  My last one was the Expert Mouse Pro, and I absolutely loved it--except when dog hair or other junk got in it.  Then it was a mild annoyance \'til I blew the junk out, or wiped down the ball;  otherwise it was a superior product, and lasted me at least 9 years.When this year\'s birthday rolled around, the family asked me what I wanted (knowing better than to buy something like this sight unseen), and I started my research, which included going into the local Fry\'s Electronics and getting this and the Blade unpacked and set up so I could test them (not connected to a machine, but at least on the desk), and the 64325 really impressed me.  Yes, the scroll ring could be described as ""feeling cheesy"", but I prefer its action over that of the Blade;  plus, the issues with key assignments and scroll control turned me off the Blade.So I pulled the trigger.It\'s an excellent trackball.  The ball is almost silky smooth, and gets better daily.  The position is just fine for how I set up my desk and keyboard, so I have no issues there.  I\'m also a gamer, and just like its older brother, it\'s fast, accurate, and easy to use within the games.My only beef is not with the trackball itself, but with Kensington, for not making Vista x64 drivers--or any Vista drivers, for that matter.  This has forced me to find alternative solutions via Google that are quite simply kludges, and not perfectly executed.  If Kensington didn\'t have this part of the market cornered, or if someone else had a similar trackball, I would\'ve gone to them if they had the drivers I needed.  I feel that Kensington made a grave mistake in not writing drivers for Vista (or any other future version of ANY OS) for the older trackballs.  Hence why my rating is only a 4, and not a 5.Other than that, this is an awesome product, one I heartily recommend... if you use Windows XP or below.  Though, the kludge does work (except for a slightly annoying screen jump once in while after scrolling), so if Vista and Win7 users want this, by all means do it:  SOMEONE out there will shame Kensington yet again with a workaround.',)"
"('A little background:  I first discovered the kensington track ball back in the early \'90\'s while studying for my Computer Science degree.  It was the greatest, coolest idea I had ever heard of relative to the PC accessories world, and ever since then I\'ve been yearning for my own.  I never really had the extra money to justify paying a $[...] for a glorified mouse, so I just waited.  Meanwhile, years later, I chose the Logitech Cordless Trackman Optical.  Finally, I seized the opportunity to buy this Kensington (a month ago) due to a $[...] off sale.After using my beloved Expert Mouse, I\'m not as thrilled by it as before.  Over the years I think some companies have caught up and implemented a better ""trackball"".  I\'m a freelance photographer and need the precise tracking and functionality for my graphics programs.1.  All the buttons are basically the same.  The same feel, the same basic shape.  You can\'t learn the different buttons thru touch other than the 4-corner positions.  The Logitech Trackman does a much better job than the Kensington on this.2.  The ""reach"" for the top two buttons is difficult due to the size of the ball, especially when your fingers are moving from the bottom two.  Having a different texture or noticeable shape would help when you\'re blindly trying to control (or orient) the mouse.3.  You CANNOT program the ring!!!  This is so ridiculous until its beyond me!  The wheel on the Logitech is fully programmable, AND can be pushed down just like a mouse button for even additional functionality!  I used to be able to assign the ""ring"" or ""wheel"" to zoom in and out on some of my graphics apps, but no more with this Kensington.  I am really disappointed in this.4.  The ""ring"" does not track accurately in one of my apps and feels cheaply put together (that\'s the only part though).  In scrolling up and down, sometimes you\'ll have to move the ring over a couple or three ""notches"" before the page will move, then the very next ""notch"" will advance the page correctly.  It should move the page with each ""notch"".  For a $[...] mouse this is unacceptable.5.  Mouse buttons are too soft.  In resting my hand comfortably on the trackball I constantly ""trip"" the buttons because of this.  Very irritating.  I\'ll be looking at a web page, and then all of a sudden the browser will go back to the previous page because I\'ve inadvertently pressed the ""back"" button.I\'m gonna try and adjust to it, but I\'ve been seriously considering going back to the Logitech.  Oh, the Logitech is $[...] regular price.  I bought this one for $[...] after rebate and still feel that I paid too much.Hope this helps someone!',)"
"(""Your search is over! The Samsung 43&quot; HDTV monitor has spectacular HDTV digital picture quality! Digital light processing (DLP) is a significant advancement in digital imaging technology; noticeably better than both plasma and liquid crystal displays. This monitor is the centerpiece of my home theater. Unexpectedly, it is a shoehorn fit into a 38&quot; wide cabinet opening. My cabinet was originally designed for a traditional 36&quot; tube.The Samsung 43&quot; monitor depth is approximately 15.7&quot;, therefore it cannot hang on a wall, like a 5&quot; thick plasma or LCD display. If this is acceptable, DLP is superior in every essential picture related factor. It weighs a meager 65 lbs. It is cheaper in price and cannot suffer from &quot;burn-in&quot;, in comparison to a plasma display. It has a user replaceable lamp that Samsung estimates will last 8,000 hours. Brightness is exceptionally good, even with sunlight entering the room.Traditional direct view or cathode ray tubes (CRT) are relics of a bygone era, but are relatively cheap. CRT size is limited, yet sales may linger for a while longer. CRTs will become extinct, as DLP prices become comparable. Some manufacturers' claims that a CRT can display HDTV 1080i images is misleading. I think the tuners simply accept and convert an HDTV component signal by downgrading it to the lesser capability of an analog CRT.  (See Consumer Reports magazine reviews.)Texas Instruments is the manufacturer of the core DLP microprocessor technology. Today is 11/3/2003. DLP HDTV monitors are available from Samsung, RCA, Mitsubishi, Optoma and LG Electronics. More manufacturers are bound to introduce monitors using this DLP technology, while others may hesitate to license the key chip from an outside source.In my humble opinion, plasma deserves a solid A-, whereas DLP should get an A+. I am a pro-consumer who did his homework. I am not a professional reviewer, nor do I have any special interest or bias favoring a particular manufacturer or technology. I love to watch very high quality TV in my home theater. I rent an HDTV decoder from Comcast and found HDTV picture sources are unbelievable. The best DVDs produce a very enjoyable B+ picture, but a true HDTV picture is breathtaking. Ultimately, all broadcast television must meet minimum HDTV standards.DLP prices depend upon Texas Instrument's ability to mass produce DLP processors - outpacing a booming demand is a key pricing factor. If price trends are like computer microprocessors, then plasma and LCD will have an uphill struggle to compete with DLP sales."",)"
"(""AMAZING Wire!i want to be honest as i review this wire and theIrwin 2078305 Vise-Grip 5-Inch Wire Stripper and Cutterwire cutters together.  I have not installed a custom system in about 10 years! Back in Denver and in Jeddah i used to get into meticulous details of how these things should be cut and installed etc.  Frankly middle age has caught up with me! and i take things much easier now without making a big fuss.I am aware that any thick shielded wire will always do a good job of total sound imaging; this is especially true when you are working with a semi-highend A/V Receiver  likeYamaha RX-V1800BL 7.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black).  This wire upgrade was about 5 years late! i have been just putting it off till i eventually get a mid-range amp. I had forgotten how this stuff works and it took me a while to get into it again.Let me talk about my setup for a second before i dwell into the wire itself:Yamaha RX-V1800BL 7.1-Channel Home Theater Receiver (Black)Polk Audio Monitor Series CS2 Center Channel Speaker (Single, Cherry)Yamaha YST-SW325 8-Inch Advanced YST II and QD-Bass Subwoofer, BlackFront and rear channels are still stock Panasonic speakersPioneer Elite BDP-05FD - Blu-Ray disc player - upscalingVenturer HD DVD Player - SHD7000OPPO DV-980H 1080p Up-Converting Universal DVD Player with HDMI and 7.1CH AudioApple MA711LL/A TV with 40GB Hard DriveI was running some twisted pair cables on the entire grid of speakers and when i bought the amp, i was advised to upgrade the cables. For the center speaker cable explicitly i got theMonster Cable XPMS-30 Monster XP Clear Jacket (Compact Speaker Cable 30 ft. piece)(since i realized that center channel output has to be the best possible) The rest of the Polk/Panasonic stock speakers i got the ACOUSTIC RESEARCH AP-16100W 100'  White 16 Gauge Oxygen-Free Speaker Wire.  Plus i needed a propper cutter.The Irwin 2078305 Vise-Grip 5-Inch Wire Stripper and Cutter took care of that process. This is very good tool for novices who did not cut wires before! or in my case haven't touched this in about 10 years! After a few tries, i felt i was cutting perfect wires again!  It took me a while (sadly i lost allot of the Monster wire learning to cut again!) until i got the wires together.But i can tell the sound definitely has changed from even those low end Panasonic speakers! u can tell how much a good speaker wire can change the total sound output. Plus not to mention that i am using a good AV receiver which needs good wires! They were easy to cut too; much easier than the Monster cables.I ordered another set of these wires once more since i liked them so much! i may need them for the next 7.1 upgrades.  They are reasonably priced too!"",)"

"(""This was easily the least expensive camera backpack I could find, and for the price it is excellent.  Looks nice, sturdy materials and zippers, lots of room, adequate (but only adequate) padding.  The downside (and none of this is a very big deal) is that the camera space isn't really camera-shaped.  Just a large space at the top and a padded column I shove the lens down into.  It works, but I'd like to see the camera nestled in a bit more.  There are straps on the bottom to hold your tripod, but they aren't quick-release straps and I think I'd get tired of fumbling with them on any trip where I was taking the tripod in and out a lot.  It also makes it awkward to set the backpack down.  Something along the side would have been better.  These are fairly minor complaints.  It looks like a backpack which has been modified for camera gear rather than something designed from the ground up for cameras.  I'm happy with the purchase, and for the price I would buy it again and recommend it to a friend."",)"

The only thing I would do differently is NOT use the velcro pockets on the side for ANYTHING of value.  Everytime you step on or off the ship, you do the entire X-ray, cavity search, etc TSA routine.  I lost alot of small stuff out of the side pockets.  Their flaps let small stuff leak through the TSA security x-ray and bucket brigade.Positives.  I used this solidly every day for 15 days to cary 3 ea E-300 backs, 1 50mm prime lens, 1 14-54 mm zoom, and 1 50-200 mm along with a teleconverter, 2 flashes (a long range and a ring flash), and a 300+ volt rapid recharge flash accessory for short recharge times, typically under 1/2 second.  There are plenty of pockets - as I mentioned the side pockets are vulnerable to loosing contents inside Xray machines, but the main compartment is amazing.  The straps that crosshatch the back did a great job holding the strobe power supply while allowing the coiled cord to exit to the strobe attachment point - it was a very effective system even allowing the rapid strobe charger to run and to stay cool while in the pack.All backs were carried mated to their associated lens - avoiding the risk of changing lenses in the field.  The main camera back had the dual battery accessory on it - the two smaller ones did not and went face to face like lenses with padding.  All of this, plus the macro hardware went in the main compartment.  If I were not on a ship with narrow passages, I could have tied my tripod to the two straps under the main bag but I chose not to as I\'d get stuck in so many tight spaces if I did.  There are also two heavy mounted 1"" strap ties on the sides that can be used to attach other cases to the pack.Padding is very generous inside the main compartment, so your preciuos cargo is protected against drops and mishandling by those people who keep us safe  (HINT - put UV filters on all lenses before traveling - TSA likes to touch the glass on your lens to make sure its not a bomb)I was simply amazed that I could carry so much in a compact backpack, have it organized ready to pull the right camera for that quick shot, and still have every accessory needed for a full day\'s shooting on the run.  Empty, the pack is very light and adds little weight to your overall load.  The zippers are all well attached to handle some stretching - they held up well without damage.  All cameras survived the trip and the bag looks good as new.  It was, of course, my carry on item, so it got the most scrutiny and fingerpoking by TSA\'s ""challenged"" employees.If you are planning a trip with cameras and accessories, this *IS* the best way to make it through security and still have working equipment on the other side.  I doubt you will find anything as well thought out at a camera store for this price either.I did not try fitting any video equipment in this pack as it travels in a hard pelican case.  Holding 3 D-SLR cameras and all accessories speaks volumes as to its ability though.  This is a keeper for traveling and just general storage.',)"

"('This is good quality linked metal chain with a plastic tubing tightly fit on the outside. For me the plastic is fine as I think the bare metal would tend to catch on your hair and certain types of clothing. I did note that the ""plastic coating"" which some don\'t like is in fact a tubing over the outside of the chain.. If you don\'t like it, it could be cut and peeled off, leaving the metal chain.For me the chain seems just a bit short, but I confess that it is probably about right for most, leaving the device hanging just below your breast bone on your stomach. It works fine for having the camera ""at the ready"". The problem is it has the ""dangles"".. it swings snd flops around. If your device is small enough, you could tuck it into a shirt pocket. If you really want to use this for a full-size camera, I\'d suggest you get one of the ""elastic snap"" type units that hold the camera to your chest until you want it, but you can lift it because it\'s on an elastice strap. Of course that type harness is considerably more expensive ie:OP/TECH USA 5301422 Bino/Cam Harness (Elastic). My camera is quite small, so it\'s fine for me.It seems to be quite strong too. I don\'t know what the tensil breaking point of it would be, but it would take quite a tug. My primary concern is dropping my camera or having someone grab it. This solves that issue. Given the goal, I much prefer this kind of strap to a wrist strap as your hands are not so encumbered. The actual loop attachment is standard for almost all lanyards I\'ve seen. It is pretty strong, but one might consider a metal snap or keyring as reinforcement. The material on here is quite strong but I\'m sure over time it will wear and break.Taking the device off this strap would be a bit of a chore, so I am conflicted as to whether I want this kind of fixed attachment or one which can be snapped loose should you want to do so (example:Amzer Detachable Cell Phone Neck Lanyard)..  I have not tried the detachable one yet.I rated it 4-star as it is just what it promises and seems well-built, but the attachment weak link subtracts just a bit given that it is advertised as ""metal"". In fairness I knew that when I ordered it.I would warn folks however to watch out for the kinds of activities you do so you don\'t get it caught in a door or have it catch on something. I had a sad event once when riding on a amusement park ride and a strap slung out hitting a fixed post and flinging my spare lens about 30 yards onto the pavement. Of course if you should be doing something like that, having it fly off is probably preferable to it dragging you with it.. :D so you want it strong, but not TOO strong! LOLEdit 3/13  The price of this has gone up ridiculously.. it is now well over $10.. too much..it was about $5 when I bought it.. Forget it at these new prices! There are too many nice options',)"

"(""I love buying the best value lenses from Canon like the blazingly fast 50mm 1.8 or the razor sharp 85mm 1.8. The 17-40 L is no exception; in fact it's the best value lens from Canon in my opinion, how so? Consider the following features.RANGE: I use this lens on the Rebel XT. With a 1.6 crop factor this lens will provide an angel of view of 27-64. That's a great range for taking pictures in the forest preserve for example. It would have been nice if the lens was a little longer (more like 80mm on 1.6 a body), but with 8MP and Photoshop crop function does it really matter? Not really, I always crop to create beautiful animal pictures in post processing and still maintain excellent picture quality for prints up to 8-10 inches.SIZE & CONSTRUCTION: Yes I list this second because this lens blows away all other canon lenses that I own in construction quality. Its solid as a tank and it balances the XT so well that I can hand hold it with confidence and comfort. Although it weight 1.1 pounds the lens never felt too heavy, just right.SHARPNESS: very sharp at all apertures, but best by 8.0. I am close to affirming that this lens will produce sharpness at par with many primes at that aperture. That's very impressive if you consider that is still a zoom even if it's an L.CONVENIANCE: Coming from using mostly primes its so much fun to use a zoom like this one. Now I pretty much own 4 lenses in one. Yes think of it as owning the 20mm + 24mm + 28mm + 35mm none L primes for half the price combined. The only draw back is that this lens is 1-2 stops slower than those lenses. Otherwise it's almost or as sharp and more convenient to use.FOCUS DISTANCE: Did you ever see pictures where the foreground is dominated with a small object like a flower and then in the background there is a grand scene of open land? This lens gives you the ability to take those pictures because its closest focusing distance is under 1 foot. That means you will be able to get close to objects compared to other zooms. Don't over estimate the convenience of ultra zooms like 28-300mm. Those lenses restrict your ability to crop and create beautiful composition, because their minimum focus distance is higher. With the 17-40 however, all what you have to do is focus correctly, compose with tight crop, and then shoot at f11-16.DISTORION CONTROL: This lens doesn't come free of distortions, especially so at the wide end where you can notice some barrel distortion. But overall its very capable at controlling distortion. That includes distortions like chromatic aberation, light fall off, vigetting, and flare. It doesn't eliminate those things completely, but controls them so well that such problems will go unnoticeable. I would love to have a distortion free lens. After all, with the challenges of getting lighting and composition right who needs lens distortions to deal with on the top of those two things? But the fact to the matter is that all lenses have some level of distortion and this lens is pretty good at controlling them especially if you take its price into account and that's what I will discuss next.VALUE: At the $600 range this lens offers an incredible value. No other lens in that price range offers the same quality build, distortion control, and image quality. The best part however, is that this lens holds its value really well. You can sell it used if you ever have to for close to what you bought it for. Now that's a lens I can't refuse!There are many great value lenses, but each comes with a weakness. For example, the 50mm is very cheap in construction and the 85mm is soft on the wide end. The 17-40 L on the other hand is just amazing! It did not disappoint me in anyway except possibly its limited reach on the upper end (40mm only). Otherwise I see no weakness in this lens. Some people may consider the 4.0 maximum aperture too low, but it served my landscape and nature needs incredibly well. If you need an extra stop for portrait or no flash concerts get the 16-35 2.8. Otherwise this is the lens!"",)"
"(""Most photographers who consider themselves serious amateurs and probably almost all professionals will have at least occasional need for an ultrawide lens. Interiors, architectural exteriors, and some travel scenes are best recorded by a lens whose angle of acceptance approaches or exceeds 100 degrees. If you like and want to produce images in which large foreground objects play against smaller objects in the background while all remain in sharp focus, an ultrawide lens is a necessity. Some may also be surprised to hear that the ultrawide lens can produce interesting portraits when the goal is not just to show the individual, but rather to set a person in a context and let the environment become part of the portrait. For decades the usual focal length for such a lens has been 17mm, though of course even wider lenses, including those which do not attempt rectilinear correction, are available for special purpose image capture. This lens is an ultrawide zoom that pretty much covers the entire wide-angle range that most photographers will need -- extremely wide at the low end and just below normal at the upper.Its advantages include its utility as an all-purpose wide angle lens (capture range from slightly wide to ultrawide) and its relatively low price for a complicated semi-specialty lens. At f/4 it is not a fast lens, and as has been pointed out in other reviews it suffers from slight softness at some apertures. It is one of Canon's L (red ring) lenses, which are higher-end products, and one can trust the company to have minimized the negative issues that can emerge in complex lens designs. If you feel the need for a perfectly satisfactory wide-angle zoom or primary lens, but don't want to break the bank to get the best one, this is a good lens to consider.On the other hand, if you want a faster lens with a bit more lateral grasp, Canon also offers the 16-35mm f/2.8 zoom lens (also in the red ring/L class) at about twice the price of this one. The more expensive lens offers not only what the 17-40mm zoom does (though it does not go quite as close to a normal focal length on the high end), but provides in addition extra light capture for lower-light environments and the slightly wider angle of acceptance. If I had thought a little longer about the differences between the two lenses, I would have ordered the more expensive one. I may upgrade at some point in the future if I ever feel constrained in the use of the one I did buy. But I am not dissatisfied with this lens and have no qualms giving it the five-star rating it deserves in its own right. It is a solid and reliable tool, well made, and provides excellent images."",)"
"('01-03-2009 Canon 5D Mark II use update""A so so walk around lens on my 40D becomes a wide angle monster on my Canon 5D Mark II. This lens is soft wide open at F/4 but sharpens up noticeably at F/4.5 and becomes a super wide angle take it all in landscape and interior monster when stopped down to F/9 on a Canon 5D Mark II. This is a lens I always carry with me now since I never know when I might see a wide angle opportunity. Doesn\'t have the you are there feeling when viewing the photos on my iMac as much as the Canon 85mm F/1.2 II L or Canon 100-400 IS L lenses but it\'s closer to perfection then you will ever see on a cropped sensor camera. I keep hoping that Canon will make a wide angle zoom that matches the performance of my Canon 100-400 IS L zoom lens.  The 24-70 F/2.8 seems pretty similar in performance as the 17-40 it\'s just faster and has more reach.  I normally prefer the 17-40 F/4 L over the 24-70 on the 5D Mark II unless I am shooting weddings and then I carry both with me.Pros:Very nice lens bag includedCenter is sharp even at F/4Love that high quality L Lens buildLens hood included and easy to installGreat contrast, beautiful rich color imagesSuper quiet and super fast USM auto focusGreat landscape lens super sharp at F/8 and 17mmGood walk around lens for cropped sensor camera, ultra wide lens when used on a full frame sensor camera.This lens has Auto Lens Vignetting correction using peripheral Illumination control see Auto Vignetting comments belowButtery smooth zoom and manual focus ringsFits all Canon EOS cameras including full frame film and 5DFirst copy I got was good to go with no quality control issuesSharper on the wide end 17 to 24mm then Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS and Canon 24-70 F/2.8 L but much softer then them on the narrow end 40mm.Cons:Only F4, wish it was F2.8 or even F3.5Lens Hood is very bulky and hard to storeRather narrow 17-40 zoom range: 17-55 would have been nicerVery soft wide open in the corners, sharpens a lot at F/4.5Could be sharper on the corners on the narrow end 24mm to 40mm and wide openFirst impressions:If you are an older photographer like me you remember the good ole days when all SLR 35mm style lens had a quality feel to them.  Built to last forever with smooth zoom and focusing and they came with a lens hood and carrying bag.  Details included a built in lens focusing scale in both feet (green lettering) and meters (white lettering) and an infrared scale adjustment in red lettering.  The lens mounted to the camera body with a precision feel like the two were actually made by experienced craftsman who actually cared about the product they were creating.  It\'s a great quality feel that you can get used to.  With this Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM lens that\'s exactly what you are getting, a finally crafted functional work of art.I never cease to be amazed at USM auto focus, so quiet, so fast, so accurate, so useful with the auto-focus manual focus override without turning off the auto focus.  I shoot both wild life and weddings both of which require at times the camera be as quiet as possible up to the moment you shoot.  This lens delivers; I can barely hear it focus even with my ear against the lens and can not hear it focus at all only a couple of feet from the lens.Decisions Decisions:Like a lot of other people I was looking to upgrade my basic Kit 18-55 lens (very soft muddy lens) I got with my Canon Rebel XTi camera.  And like a lot of people I wanted a lens that I would never outgrow or tire of or wear out.  I take a lot of photos and frequently upgrade camera bodies and wanted a lens that will also work on a full frame camera like the 5D.I had borrowed a friends 17-70 Sigma and it was really sharp and for the money (less then half the price of the Canon 17-40) I thought I would try one even though it wouldn\'t work on a full frame camera.  I went through three copies and all were bad before deciding to go back to the 17-40.  Man what a great decision going with the Canon 17-40.  Thanks to 47th Street photo for being so nice about the whole return twice then later upgrade from Sigma to Canon situation.  I only had to pay return shipping.Testing:When I received my new Canon 17-40 I took it out, mounted it on my Canon Rebel XTi and mounted the camera on a tripod, put on a remote release, set the camera to mirror lockup mode, Aperture Propriety at F8,  28mm zoom and tested it both against my friends Sigma 17-70 and my own basic Canon 18-55 kit lens.  The 17-40 absolutely blew the kit lens out of the water: in sharpness, contrast and richness of color.  Then I tried it against the Sigma which I thought was a sharp lens and the Canon 17-40 was sharper and had more contrast then the Sigma.  Then I set it to 40mm and shot against my Canon 50mm F1.8 II lens which I thought was pretty sharp and it was better then it as well.  I then tried the lens in various conditions and settings and all extremes both indoors and out with and without flash.  I also own a Canon 70-200 F2.8 L and it\'s sharper then it as well at some settings.I was very pleased to find out that the very first copy of this lens right out of the box was sharp enough and auto focus was right on the money!Auto Vignetting peripheral illumination control:Canon has this super sweet Auto Lens Vignetting correction that works with this lens both in camera with JPEG\'s and in RAW using peripheral Illumination control in Canon Digital Photo Professional (DPP) when using newer Canon digital EOS cameras (Canon Rebel XSi, 40D, 5D Mark II etc.) . No more vignetting when shooting wide open!!! When shooting Raw open the file(s) in DPP and click on NR/Lens Lens Aberration Correction / Tune and click on Peripheral illumination. The cameras listed above have already picked up the amount of vignetting based on focusing distance, zoom setting and F stop from the lens and the camera has saved the information with the Raw file. You can then adjust the amount under Peripheral Illumination if you don\'t like the amount automatically suggested. If you shot JPEG then you get the auto amount. SWEET!!!Conclusion:If you want THE best wide angle L lens to use on both cropped and ultra wide for full sized sensor Canon EOS camera bodies this is it.  It\'s dual purpose capabilities both as a normal walk around zoom (27mm to 64mm) on cropped sensor cameras and ultra wide zoom (17mm to 40mm) on full sized sensors make it a very versatile lens you won\'t out grow.I am very pleased and heartily recommend the Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens.12-4-2007 UpdateI love this lens more then ever and I use it here at work a lot.  Since I take photos usually tripod mounted with a small depth of field F-8 to F-11 and shoot a lot in the 17 - 28mm zoom range this lens really fits the bill when mounted on my Canon Rebel XTi.  I continue to be impressed with the sharp high contrast photos and the super fast auto focus.One note of warning, this lens sticks out especially without the lens hood on.  I have since taken to having a lens filter mounted on it (B & W 77mm UV (Ultra Violet) Haze Multi Coated (2C) Glass Filter #010) to protect it although it seems to really degrade the sharpness and to some extent the contrast colors of the image.  I\'m hoping to find a filter that does not degrade the image at all and am doing tests at all the local camera stores to try and find one.  Will post here when I find a great filter as I would like to buy one for my Canon 70- 200 to protect it as well and since it\'s the same filter size I could even switch back and forth.  For now when I have the lens tripod mounted and want the best image quality I remove the filter and when I am just walking around I leave the filter in place.Filter Update 1-3-2008After much searching I found the perfect filter.  The Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 Protection filter is not supposed to filter the shot just protect the front lens element.  I was very worried that it would affect the shot after having tried some other premium filters like the B+W UV which caused the photos to be softer and duller.  However, after some tests I found that in some weird way the Hoya Multi Coat HMC Pro1 actually makes the photos seem to have just a little more contrast and be a little sharper then without.  I thought I had gotten the test shots backwards and had to retest with a little sign in the photo saying with and without filter in place just to make sure.  Really amazing!!!  I\'m sold!3-28-2008Well, it was one of the sharpest lens I own.  Now I have a different standard as it\'s been surpassed by the Canon EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS lens which is sharper at the narrow end 24-40mm at every equal setting and by my Canon 135mm F/2 L and Canon 85mm F/1.2 L II.  But I still love this lens and I am going to keep it and it is very sharp on the wide end 17mm even at F4.5.  I plan to use it for ultra wide angle when Canon finally releases their Canon 5D replacement whenever that is. I also still use it on my Canon 40D and Rebel XTi when I am in dusty areas because of the weather sealing.  And the zoom action is so smooth I wish the 17-55 F/2.8 had this zoom action.  Still the colors are bright and it\'s pretty sharp and its small and light!4-17-2008 UpdateI still love this lens and use it for motorcycle rides and hiking where it\'s light weight and weather tight seal come in handy.  Plus I found that you can get an image very sharp if you process it using the Canon Digital Photo Professional that came with you camera.  I also use as a backup at weddings and for out door wide angle wedding shots and landscapes.9-22-2008 Update:I\'m getting ready to purchase or lease the new Canon 5D Mark II and boy oh boy is this 17-40 L lens going to come in handy.  One of the first places I want to take the happy couple is to the Grand Canyon.  17mm at F/10 tripod mounted oh YEAH!!!  True wide angle bliss!!!10-07-2008 Update:I recently had a question as to why I bought the Canon 17-40 F/4 L lens instead of the Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens.  All EF-S lenses only work on cropped sensor cameras (Rebels, 40D, 50D etc).  I have ordered a new 5D Mark II full frame sensor which can not use the EF-S 10-22mm lens.  A full frame sensor camera makes the 17-40 lens at 17mm as wide as the 10-22 zoom is when the 10-22 is set at 11mm.  So there is only a 1 mm advantage with the EF-S 10-22 on a cropped sensor camera vs the 17-40 on a full frame sensor camera.  And the 17-40 has a much wider zoom range about double in fact.So bottom line on the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 vs the EF 17-40mm F/4 L if you only plan on using a cropped sensor camera then the EF-S 10-22mm lens could be the right lens for you.  However, if you are planning on moving up to a full frame sensor camera like the 5D or 5D Mark II then you can use the 17-40 L lens now with your cropped sensor camera as a walk around lens (it just won\'t be as wide) and then when you get a full frame sensor camera you will have all the wide angle glory and still be able to use the lens on both cameras.  If you never plan on buying full frame and want super wide angle you should go with the EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5.10-17-2008 Update:I\'ve noticed this lens is very SOFT in the corners wide open at F/4.0.  Which is OK if you are looking for that say when shooting a wedding but not good when shooting landscapes.  But sharpens up a lot in the corners by going to F/4.5 and is as sharp as it\'s going to get by around F/8 where it seems about as sharp as any zoom I have and is approaching the sharpness of a prime lens at 17mm.[...][...][...]',)"
"('Great lens and a super price. Really nice that the UV filter was free too.',)"
"(""As a beginner with a DSLR, there are so many lenses that one can easily get overwhelmed with choices. Before we get into the actual review, here are some quick tips to keep in mind - for portraits, you want a lens with at least a focal length of 80mm or more. For macro shots, 100mm or more. For landscape, you want a wide angle lens 28mm and below. For general use photography, you want around 50mm lens. However, these focal lengths are relevant when used on a full frame body like the Canon 6D or the 5D Mk III. When you have an APSC camera body (like the Canon Rebel series, Canon 70D, or Canon 7D), there is a 1.6x crop factor to take into account, as APSC cameras crop the image that's taken to fit its sensor.Build Quality-weighing in at 10.9oz (310g), this adds some weight to your camera body, but still not too much weight compared to telephoto lenses. The build quality is sturdy, feels expensive and made in Japan, with a metal mount, huge glass, and a big rubber dial for full-time manual focusing.USM Motor-provides fast and quiet autofocus action; unlike the cheaper 50mm 1.8, the focusing system of the Canon 28mm 1.8 is in the rear of the lens, so there is no external movement during focusing as seen on the 50mm 1.8 where the lens move in and out at the front of the lens body.Minimal Focusing Distance-0.25m (0.8ft) is shorter when compared to Canon 50mm 1.8's 0.45m (1.5ft), which just means you can get much closer to your subject for macro shots. This is also very suitable for indoor shooting, especially when you have limited space to work with and don't want your back against a wall whilst taking pictures.Price-The price of this lens is very affordable when compared to the more coveted yet expensive L lens in a similar focal length - the Canon 24mm 1.4, which costs almost 4x as much.Thus, the Canon 28mm 1.8 is effectively 44.8mm focal length on a crop sensor APSC body, which is great for general use photography or as a walk-around lens. As with any prime lens, you have to use your feet to zoom in when you compose pictures. Additionally, at an f stop of 1.8, this lens works perfectly at night and in low light conditions, especially indoors such as in museums or other buildings where lighting is low. Also, this is one fast lens - autofocuses consistently and quickly before every shot. Now, while there are some negative reviews out there arguing that this lens is very soft - from my experience so far, I agree that the lens is soft at f 1.8, but once you go to 2.0 - 5.6, it gets very sharp. I usually shoot around 2.0 - 2.8 to get sharp images with a nice bokeh effect.Overall, this is one of the lenses that every photographer, beginners and pros alike, should have in their camera bag. At a great focal length that can be used as a wide angle lens on a full frame body or as a general purpose lens on an APSC cropped camera body without breaking the piggybank and short of an expensive L lens, this is one lens that one musn't pass up. Other great prime lenses to consider is the Nifty Fifty (Canon 50mm 1.8), and the Shorty Forty (Canon 40mm 2.8) aka pancake lens for DSLR beginners."",)"
"('I only got deep into bird and wildlife last summer when I purchased Canon\'s EF 400mm f/5.6L. That\'s a fine lens and I thought that the image quality was very good, but I longed for more ""reach"" and a faster aperture that would autofocus with my 1.4 teleconverter.A professional photographer freind let me handle his EF 600mm f/4L and his EF 500mm f/4.5L (both are older models) and the added length and weight of the 600mm focused me totally on the 500mm for my bag. My friend is using his 600mm on a full-frame camera while I\'m using my 500mm on a 1.6 crop-sensor Canon 7D. On that sensor the 500mm gives a field of view equivalent to 800mm (1.6X500). When I add my 1.4TC II the equivalent focal length is 1,120mm!!! That\'s amazing power for a lens that will fit in my LowPro backback.For stunning pictures at all shutter speeds and shooting over an extended periods of time, a stout tripod and gimbal is suggested. I\'m using the eight-ply, carbon fiber Induro C414 tripod with an Arca-Swiss Z1 ballhead and the Wimberley Sidekick half-gimbal. This setup is extremely stable and you can turn off the lens\' IS. I leave it in mode 2 for panning. That said, this lens yields very sharp images when handheld. The IS is truly effective. To see it, just focus on something stationary without pushing the shutter button to activate the IS. You\'ll see the image moving and shaking, then push the shutter button and the subject almost ""locks"" into place, as if it\'s on the tripod. Yes, there\'s still small movement, but at 1/1000th to 1/2000th shutter speeds typical in bird photography, everything is sharp.  (Remember the old rule, for every 100mm of focal length you need 1/100th second of shutter speed, so the minimum with this lens would be 1/500th, even when shooting something that\'s not moving. (Factor in a crop-sensor that might be 1/800th second). At those speeds the IS gives very clear results.The auto focuse of this lens is really fast and mostly ""snaps"" instantly into focus. You DO need to be aware of the subject distance and move the switch for a close subject and remember to move it back for a distant subject. Be aware of your camera\'s AF mode. For instance, for birds in flight I use 9 sensors in a square box in the middle of the sensor. For birds in the bush, I use single point in order to look past twigs and such. For things like a passing boat or car it hardly matters which mode your camera is in. When used with my 1.4TC II, the AF snaps seemingly just as quickly.My Flickr site is [...] Cut and paste if you want to see examples, Tagged ""EF 500mm f/4L IS""I see much superior image quality to my EF 400mm f/5.6L. A big part of this is the effective focal length over 1,000mm when used on a crop-sensor camera and with the 1.4TC, which gives you a frame-filling subject. I still need to crop many of my bird images, but it\'s mainly for compositional values. This lens is large and does attract a crow (probably the biggest negative) but it gets the job done.',)"

"('I purchased this bag and received it about two weeks ago. Since then, I am desperately trying to fit just a simple walk around kit in this bag - much frustration and no success. I can\'t think of any reason why Domke calls this bag a ""pro system bag"".The bag has one main compartment which takes easy a Nikon D300 or similar size camera with battery grip - without lens! The two extremely small lens compartment will then hold a regular small diameter lens each, like the Nikon 18-55 VR, or the 55-200 VR. These are no pro lenses Mister Domke!Okay, possibly Domke ment a ""medium size camera"" as a pro equipment - I believe that in the advertisement is a Hasselblad on the picture... Now, I have a Mamiya RZ67 - the plain body would fit in the main department, the film back in the outside pocket and the lens I would have to carry in my hands, because not even one single lens would fit!Pro? Nonsense!If you own a regular full size SLR, without grip, and use regular standard (amateur) lenses, you probably will be happy with this bag. If you own a larger camera, or SLR with grip, and pro lenses like the 24-70 f/2.8, you will be out of luck with this bag. By the way, the outside pockets (3) are large and take all accessories you like to carry, but they are not patted (protected).So in summary: Yes, it is a nice bag. It looks good, and is of superior workmenship. Nevertheless, it is not water proof or dust proof, because there is no zipper, and all the lid\'s are not closing the compartments fully - it actually can rain freely into the bag, especially in the outside pockets.Okay, I still like this good weather bag, and I use it now the following way:I took the grip of my D300 and carry now a spare battery in the outside pocket.I have the 24-70mm f/2.8 mounted on the camera and the camera sticks with lens downwards in the main compartment.In the two lens compartments, I carry a Tokina 12-24 f/4 lens, and a small Nikon 55-200 f/4-5.6G VR lens. This gives me for my purposes a small walk around kit and it fits snugg and thight in this bag.The outside compartment are very sufficient for all other gear, flash, charger etc etc...Okay, the bag might deserve 4 or 5 stars for the quality - I gave only two because I like to express my anger about people who try to sell equipment, making it better or bigger than it actually is!It is a good bag, and Domke has all sizes of good bags - why blowing sand in the buyers eyes and making customers buy wrong sizes??? I would not mind paying another 50 or 100 dollars to get the right bag. I work with it every day.My final advise is:Don\'t just buy a camera bag over the internet. Go to a camera store and try one - find the right one for you, and then either buy it right there and then, or go back to your computer and order it from Amazon after you know for sure which one makes you happy. I am a pro for 30+ years and know the hassle of buying camera bags, I just thought that Domke would be straight with their description - so I figure that the ""White House Photographers"" must have very small cameras...',)"
"('I like the look and the sound.  Very happy with it.  Good value. Nice heavy enclosure. I would buy again.',)"
"(""So I bought this bag just two months after purchasing a 6 million dollar home bag from crumpler.Interested in knowing why I didnt like the Crumpler(read on):  The reason is, the crumpler bag had too much padding, I mean, I'm not going to throw the thing.  And so I didn't have much room for my gear! Also, the Crumpler bag's main flap is a huge chunk of velcro and so there's no such thing as being discreet at a wedding or any other important event.DOMKE F-6 REVIEWAppearance: i love that it's not an obvious camera bag. I mean these days everyone owns a DSLR and it's just asking to get stolen in a typical camera bag which can be spotted a mile away. I got the olive color because everyone has sand.  It's a bit greener than the photo appears, but I imagine that with use it'll become more army green.Pockets: there's a front zippered pouch that goes aross the length of the bag. Fits a bunch of stuff. extra batteries, cards, my rocket air blaster, lens wipes, card reader, etc. There's a top zippered pocket on the main flap as well.  I tend not to use that as much since my bag is pretty full and it adds strange bulkiness.Clips: some people complain that they're too hard to unclip.. not really. I have very weak hands that shake after shooting for an hour but have no problem with the clips.  If anything, you'd WANT them to be strong to ensure your gear won't fall out.Mold: it's true, the Domke bag molds to your body.  I like it because I know it won't fly off my shoulder or swing out in front of me when I bend over.Padding: some people complain about the padding.  Compared to the in store type of bags like Lowerpro/Canon/Crumpler it's true, it's definitely not as padded as those bags.  The bottom comes with a thicker board for padding.  Domke bags are used by some serious photographers, you'll never see them carrying something you can just buy at BestBuy. I'd think if you have expensive gear, you're gonna be careful with it.  Ultra padding gives you a false sense of security, allowing someone to think that they can slide or toss their bag across the table/room.  You do need to be careful with this bag but.. I would think you're being careful to begin with.WHAT DOES IT FIT: here's an important question.  This bag comes with a 4-section insert.  Personally, I don't like this set up.  With a 4-section insert, you can do one body with a short lens on it and scootch the insert all the way to the far end and stick other lenses and flashes, what have you.  If you put the insert in the middle, you can put in two bodies but with no lenses attached.WHAT I DID: I swapped out the 4-section insert with a 2-section insert. I have 2 lenses in there or 1 lens and a flash.  And then two bodies with lenses attached to them.- Canon 50D with 24-70 lens- Canon 30D with 50mm lens- 70-200mm L lens- flash/another lensAnd it fits fine.  The bag actually stretches and molds around things so it's fine. I'm no professional, but i love this bag and it fits my needs perfectly.4 stars in the end because i wish you could select your insert.. wishful thinking I know. but i'd much rather have two bodies with lenses on them and 2 additional slots vs. 2 bodies with no lenses on them.  I want to be ready to shoot when the moment arises. Having to put on a lens .. you risk missing the shot."",)"

"('Stereo headphones have come a long way over several decades, and there have been so many advances, it\'s often hard to keep up with the latest technologies.  In the beginning, there was basically only ONE type, that of being, the completely over the ear, studio-type and others.  As things progressed, ""earbuds"" of many types began to be offered and an expensive type of these have emerged, with the advent of the I-Pod and various other portable CD and MP3 players.  I\'ve never really liked these, as no matter how much one spends, they still have to snugly and comfortably fit the individual\'s ears, which is no small task, as all human ears are not created equal.  Fortunately, various forms of the original concept of over-ear, noise-canceling headphones have kept pace with the earbud variety.  Some of these are more completely over the ear than others, some are more or less outside noise-canceling types, and then there are the cheapest non-earbud types, which can vary greatly in concept and overall quality.For the best experience in private listening, one needs to spend at least $50 these days, if not upwards of $100 or more.  However, these type of stereo headphones are usually very large and are not really suited to portable, on the go listening.  Still, they do not suffer from the earache of buds, and usually produce the best overall, robust sound.  In between most earbud types and most larger ""monitor"" types, there are so many varieties nowadays, that the general, plug-in stereo-headphones shopper is usually left quite confused when trying to pick out a suitable, high-quality model, at a reasonable price.  For almost all purposes, this is a really good buy, and I give them high marks in just about every headphone category one can think of or desire.  And the asking price is a bargain.One little caveat however.  The Amazon ""product description"" and even mentioned in a review or two, state that the cord length is nearly 10 feet.  I think this must be referring to some earlier model or just a mistake, because the cord length of these is only about 6 feet total.  While this does not interfere with my personal use or intentions of use before I even bought a pair, sound unheard, I think this should be pointed out.  The difference between a 10-foot cord length and a 6 foot one is rather substantial.  Therefore, these are in no way suitable for ""roaming the room"" or dancing ""to your heart\'s content,"" as the Amazon product description states.  Amazon should correct this product description.  If one desires more than a six-foot cord length however, a cheap extension can always be purchased for a few bucks at Radio Shack and the like.  It\'s a 6 foot cord though, not 10.Outside of this however, these are really great headphones for the price, and offer terrific sound and value.  While they are ""fold-able"" in a way, this only applies somewhat, as they are not completely so, and attempts at making the set truly small for carrying purposes might only break them.  While they are ""over-the-ear,"" they are not entirely of the more expensive, truly ""noise-canceling"" variety, though they do a fair job at this, again, for the price.  The earphones are padded and the set is nicely adjustable for nearly all head sizes, unless you have the head size of a mouse or Eraserhead.  Extended use is no problem, once you easily adjust them to comfortably fit personally.  That is, wearing these for hours will not cause any real head/ear strains or pains, either during use or afterwards, volume levels and adjustments aside.These tend to lean heavily towards the bass frequencies and are enhanced to do so, although the mid-range and upper-ranges come through very good as well.  Still, since there is no equalizer function, it helps that whatever source you will be listening to with these, can be adjusted itself.  That is, if you are using these to listen to a CD or MP3 player, it helps that you are able to use an equalizer at the source, since again, the bass response here is emphasized.  I use these mainly for the computer, and my CD/MP3 player on that is fully adjustable as far as regulating highs, mids, and lows, so the extra bass is no problem.  Still, even if one is not able to adjust low and mid and high end frequencies on your player source, the overall sound is excellent on generally all forms of music and sounds, and the stereo separation between left and right is, well, right on.I have always had a generally good experience with Panasonic products, and that includes higher-end, higher priced headphones from them.  While these are rather cheaply made and fragile, if you take care of them and don\'t ask them to do what they are clearly not intended to do, you will be pleasantly surprised.  A definite bonus is the small volume control on the cord.  This comes in real handy at times, since not all music is recorded and produced at the same volume level, and this control allows one to raise or lower the volume without touching the source player.  And again, while these headphones are not really suited for any long life with heavy abuse, and might seem too ""cheaply"" made for some, taking care during use negates any such negatives and I would guess these will last and perform well just about as long as you want them to.I bought two pair of these, which got me free shipping, and I really can\'t complain.  They are great for plugging into one\'s computer, or using with any CD/MP3 player with an equalizer, but generally, they perform well for just about any purpose as far as headphones go.  They also fit nicely and comfortably as a ""necklace"" during breaks in listening.  One can easily buy much better headphones, but for the price, these offer remarkable sound at an easily affordable price, and I recommend them highly.',)"

"('I have owned this bag for about 2 years now. I loved it so much I bought one of the smaller versions for my Lumix FZ-15. I am one of those guys who has yet to find a backpack that is right sized, accessible, well made, comfy and doesn\'t scream ROB ME! I also can\'t stand slinging a standard gadget bag and trying to take pictures at the same time. And for you back pain complainers, I have had a herniated disc for 4 years now and I have no issue.So I bought the Vel 9 since it looked like an intriguing compromise between the standards. The only issue I agree with is that I would not want to be climbing or carrying this all day on my back. That\'s why I\'m still searching for the perfect backpack for me. But for a few hours at a sports event, or the zoo, or at any other venue where you want your lenses with you, I think this  does a fabulous job.However, like anything, you need to be in tune with what you want and try it first. Therefore, if this interests you, go try one out at a store. Even take your gear with you to see if it covers you and the weight. For me, it\'s like having a top access gadget bag that slings enough like a backpack that it doesn\'t fall off your shoulder but definitely doesn\'t give you full panel access like a backpack does. WHAT IT DOES give you is EASY ACCESS on the body! I hate the idea of taking a backpack off every time I need to change something. It does take a little to get used to but I find that when I want to zip out the d-rebel for a quick pic or change a lens, it just takes a quick reach over the shoulder to slide the pack up and over to your chest, one or two clips and you have what you need.As for the complaints about the compartments, they are fully flexible and basically aligned in 3 ""tubes"" with different""floors"" you can put in depending on what you are stacking in the tube. So your camera takes up most of the center ""tube"" and the outside 2 hold lenses. I keep my 35-135IS zoom on the camera, with my 50mm on the very bottom of the center tube under the end of the IS lens. My flash sits in the bottom of one of the side tubes with my wide angle on top of it (divider in between). Finally, my 70-200L lens sits on the other side. Most important, the gear underneath is actually quite easy to access because the dividers easily flip up to get things out.Since I actually have the camera in my hand most of the time, the remaining weight in the bag is no issue for most of the time. If its all in there it can be a little heavy, but again, I\'m not carrying it for hours. If it does start to annoy me on the shoulder, I actually take it off and sling it like a bag over the other shoulder for awhile.In summary, the concept of this bag is unique enough that most people are going to either love it or hate it. To find out which one you are, I suggest trying it at a camera store that stocks it. If you want a pretty large bag that carries all of a standard  SLR kit and complement of lenses, allows you on the fly access without showing the world what you have and stays securely on your back, this is it!',)"
"(""Based on a review I read, someone had used the strap on a Canon G10. Was perfect timing, becuase I just bought a G10 for my wife for her birthday.

"('the s5000 has a very nice professional feel.  it also has 10x optical zoom which is great.  but the superCCD system that fuji uses doesn\'t give as much detail as hoped for, and in the end, you have to conclude that there are better camers at this price point out there.pros:- 6-megapixel interpolated still mode.- vivid colors.- 10x optical zoom!- flexible: point and shooters have automatic selections and scene modes while creative shooters have plenty of control with manual and priority exposure modes.- continuous shooting mode.- RAW file output.- bright LCD works well even in low light.- xD card features short write times, less battery usage.- non-proprietary batteries used.  this means replacement batteries are as close as the nearest convenience store (i recommend rechargeables though).- good macro performance.- supplied lens adapter gives camera a more professional look and serves as a lens protector.- supports add-on lenses.- unlimited 30 fps 320x240 video.- adapter ring (which doubles as lens hood) included.- low redeye occurrence.- built-in AF illuminator.- not as big or heavy as i thought.  dimensions are 4.4""W x 3.2""H x 3.1""D, weighing 11.9 oz.

"('I love my 2 Megapixel Canon Elph. Small, sharp and reliable - during its time, it was all I could ask for.  I even sold a couple of its pictures to magazines, so what\'s not to love?  While I have not discarded my Elph, I recently moved up to the G5 because it\'s better in every way. With a fast 4X optical zoom (all the way out to a 35mm-camera-equivalent of 140MM) and 5 megapixel chip, it could easily become my new favorite camera. The manual is thick but it uses a lot of illustrations and the text is surprisingly clear and simple so the reader should not be intimidated. Not being one to read manuals, I was able to take the G5 out of the box and immediately shoot pictures without cracking the book (the battery came out of the box with a decent charge too - how cool is that?) That\'s how simple and intuitive the camera is. I have already made a few 8X10 prints on my Canon color printer and they are sharp, show excellent contrast and have good color balance too. Like most auto-focus digital cameras there is a brief shutter lag. It\'s not too bad but the shutter release is certainly not as quick as one of my 35mm Leicas. Speaking of Leica, the shape and size of the G5 is very close to that of the classic Leica M series cameras. And the clever design of the battery case allows it to serve as a grip - I found it comfortable and secure. (Note: a similar grip is a [$$$]option on a 35mm rangefinder Leica!) I don\'t like the fact that you can\'t screw a UV, skylight or other kind of filter on the front of the lens. I like to have a good quality filter on the front of my lenses for protection - but that\'s me. For the average camera user, there are 2 auto exposure settings that should cover the vast majority of shooting situations. (I used ""P"" and got an ""included in the box"" 32mb compact flash card full of great exposures.) For the advanced photographer, the G5 comes with just about every manual control you could need or want - similar to those on their excellent EOS 1V pro camera. One cool feature is the ability to capture a shot in both RAW and JPEG at the same time. This feature will give you a ""pure"" file with no data loss due to compression and will allow you to make the largest, sharpest print possible. (The manual says that the RAW file is compressed, but there is no data loss - must be a new form of Japanese magic!) Bottom line, the RAW format will give you the biggest file with the most information. I suspect that a RAW file will allow the careful user (i.e., one who is fussy about focus, exposure and camera shake) to make an 11X14 inch print that is as good as any 35mm camera (maybe better!)  When compared against the many excellent digital cameras out there, the Canon is a stand out. Its size, resolution, simplicity, and Canon\'s excellent reputation for reliability made it and easy choice for me.',)"
"(""this is a full-featured camera that you use as a point-and-shoot and still have the flexibility to be more creative when you want.  this fills the niche between the excellent canon s50 5MP digicam and the d-SLRs.pros:- excellent resolution from a small lens - 5MP power!- 4x optical zoom- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness- fast lens (F2.0 - F3.0)- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)- shooting priority play mode - simply half-press the shutter during playback and you're ready to shoot- impressive range of manual controls- very good shot-to-shot times, considering the larger files due to the higher resolution- nice metallic black finish - i definitely prefer this to the silver finish of other compact cameras- great fold-out LCD: nice and bright PLUS it folds away when not in use (less likely it'll get scratched)- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera- the manual focus has magnified loupe and ruler readout- flexible continuous shooting modes (buffer after processing)- RAW file format maintains 12-bits of data- ability to turn JPEG shot into RAW during record review- Compact Flash Type I/II and official Microdrive support- voice annotation feature- has a hot-shoe that allows the use of an external flash- invervalometer (time lapse capability)- AF assist lamp works well- has an included IR remote control- nice optional accessory portfolio to choose from- excellent battery life- USB connectivitycons:- where's the nine-point AiAF that's standard in Canon's own S50?- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery/CF compartment- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom- viewfinder partially obstructed by lens barrel- zoom controller does not have enough steps / multiple zoom speedyou would choose the G5 over over the s50 if you value flexibility over compactness (and you don't want to go all the way to the d-SLR range).you would choose this over the G3 because of the higher resolution, which more than makes up for the higher noise levels of the G5.this is a fantastic camera - highly recommended. enjoy!"",)"
"('It is simple. Nikon makes the best SLRs. Canon makes the best digital cameras. This is particularly true in the prosumer range, where Canon\'s Powershot Gx series beats them all with its ease of use (both hardware and software), in looks and holding comfort (which is a subjective opinion, and this is mine), in the sheer realism of the pictures etc etc.I own both the G2 and the G3, the latter being a upgrade more for the purposes of competitive response than anything else -- different bodyline, somewhat higher pixel ratio etc. Now, G5 may come across as the same with little to show for, except its black paintjob and the insiginficantly higher pixel ratio. A tad disappointing for us Canon aficianados who were expecting a bit more from the next in the series.WHAT\'S NEW:(1) Black body. Personally, I have gotten used to the silver finish, which appeals to me. I hope Canon doesn\'t standardize on black and makes the next cam available in both colors.(2) More ""megapixels"" (of course). Which doesn\'t really mean squat unless you wish to print your photographs on 20 x 30 photopaper.(3) Video recording with sound for 3 minutes (actually G3 can manage about the same).(4) This could be an important factor to some of you who believe digicams haven\'t yet reached their prime given how pathetic their focus speeds are -- G5 rocks in terms of instant clicking. G2 was painfully slow and effectively useless for sports photography for instance, G3 was a remarkable improvement, and G5 now is almost as good as EOS in its response time.Summary: what can I say. Great camera from Canon, but falls short of being spectacular as an upgrade. If you already own G2 or G3, wait for the next in the series by when let\'s hope the clicking response times should match EOS and other digital SLRs.But if you are in the market for a new digicam, this is easily the best on offer in the semipro category (as are G2, G3 etc if Canon does not make them obsolete).',)"

"('Bottom Line: The Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" is a good compromise if one needs a USB connected wireless network adapter that conforms to the Wireless-G standard.  If you can, go with a PCI adapter for much better performance.When I recently rebuilt my primary workstation I found to my chagrin that my existing Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G PCI NIC would not work in my new AOpen A4C Max motherboard.  Try as I might (a few BIOS upgrades and disabling the card) I could not get it to work, due to the integration of the Broadcom Gigabit PCI LAN Chip into the board.  Enter the ""Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G.""The Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, and supports the following wireless protocols:  802.11b and 802.11g.  The Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G can transmit and receive networking traffic in a range of 1 - 54Mbps.  I choose the Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" for three reasons; 1. The card operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz the same frequency band I currently use for my wireless communications; 2. The Linksys name is one I have come to trust for reliability and cutting edge technology; 3. The Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" is USB version. 2.0 compliant.Installation:The installation of the Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" is a very straight forward process: just plug it in--with the computer on--and it starts working!  My Microsoft Windows XP Professional Operating System (OS) found it and installed the necessary drivers, and made it ready for use.  There is no software to install; thought Linksys does provide a utility to configure the card to work with your wireless setup, which I admit a non Windows XP user might need.  However, Windows XP Professional is designed--once a wireless device is installed--to seek out available wireless networks and configure the card accordingly; i.e. assign it an IP address, if DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is used on the network.  I use DHCP on my combined wired and wireless network, but I assigned the Linksys ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" an IP address because my computer serves as my Internet gateway.If you do decide to install the software, good luck.  Like a lot of Linksys software utilities of late--even those downloaded directly from the Linksys website--the software refuses to load; e.g. the autostart start, and then stops abruptly.  So I opened Windows Explorer, browsed to the CD and double-clicked on the setup.exe under the Utility directory; no dice.  Only a token portion of the software loaded, enough of a token to keep render the card useless.  So I uninstalled the software and left it uninstall; as I pointed out above if you are using the Windows XP OS there will be no need for the software that ships with the card.  Will it install under Windows 98/Me/Se/2000?, Perhaps, but no longer owing a computer with any of those OS\'s installed, I cannot credibility speak to it.First ImpressionsI have mixed feelings about the ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" Linksys surprisingly dropped the ball in the design of this card.  While the ""Wireless-G WUSB54G"" occasionally transmits and receives at 54Mbps, the speed of the card fluctuates on a continual basis reaching as low as 1MBps, several times a minute!  I have placed the card is various locations around my loft not more than 75 feet from the Wireless Access Point (WAP), but still the fluctuating carrier speed continues to my frustration.  And while the antenna is small, it is larger than the one on the Linksys ""Wireless-G WPC54G CardBus Adapter"" installed in my notebook, which manages to maintains a consistent carrier speed of 54Mbps.This annoying pervasive fluctuating carrier speed has affected at times the speed at which I access the Internet and move file to and from my workstation and the rest of the network.  Linksys offers no advice on how to fix this problem other then the usual ""move the adapter around and adjust the antenna"" pronouncements, which do little to fix the problem.  My advice: don\'t but this card unless your computer will not support a PCI NIC.ConclusionThe ""Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G"" receives a C+ from me.  While I give the card high marks for ease of installation and configuration--thanks in part to Windows XP Professional--but I give it low marks for overall performance.  If you are looking to make the leap to the Wireless-G protocol, and leave far behind the vestiges of the now obsolete (in my mind anyway) 11Mps standard, shy away from the ""Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G"" unless no other option is open to you.',)"

"('May I introduce you to one of the least know and yet most superb lenses Canon makes. You probably even stumbled on to this page by accident, looking for another Canon lens, looking at various macros, or even just intrigued by this higher-priced lens you\'ve probably never even considered.Let me just say this about this lens: Ultra sharp. Ultra colorful. Ultra contrast. Ultra solid.Like everybody else, I initially bought this lens for its macro. The 60mm and 100mm options were a lot cheaper, but my collection is entirely L-class and I\'d learned to trust putting gobs of money into the lenses with the red ring. So I put my money where my L-faith is and went with this lens. Needless to say, my faith was rewarded again.Yeah, sure it\'s got the 1.0x macro capability, and this is important. But what I wasn\'t expecting was the image quality. It is unbelievably good. Now I\'m not somebody who\'s taking his first trip into L land and comparing this lens to the $300 run-of-the-mill glass. I\'ve used six L-class lenses significantly and I\'m comparing this lens\' image quality to THOSE.You will find yourself using this lens as much as its 180mm focal length and f/3.5 aperture dictates. The lens is versatile both as a super-fine telephoto and as a 1.0x macro.The macro capability is the main feature. 1.0x macro literally means that a 35mm wide object will completely fill a 35mm frame. Basically, it\'s a small microscope. If you dare to dial in the aperture to the wide-open f/3.5, the DOF is approximately that of the thickness of two sheets of writing paper at 1.0x. Needless to say, you\'ll need a tripod, preferably with macro rails that slide forwards and rearwards for ultimate control.(For those of you new to macro, focusing the lens changes the magnification factor. So as one focuses the object, the object\'s size in the viewfinder changes. This is why I mention the macro rails, they allow you to achieve focus and physically move the lens/camera in and out to reachieve the desired composition.)As a telephoto, due to this lens\' superb image quality, it actually produces images of a much greater quality than the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS. (I know firsthand, as I own it too)  The difference is in the 70-200mm\'s versatility. If the light drops too low, the f/2.8 and the IS bests the f/3.5 quite rapidly. If the distance of subjects change quickly or you are unable to move your feet to frame images, the 180mm will be too constricting and the zoom will win. But under conditions where the 180mm f/3.5 can perform unhindered (such as at an airshow or out flower hunting), it will consistantly produce brighter, more saturated, and sharper images than the 70-200mm F/2.8 IS.There is a complaint that circulates about the slow speed at which this lens autofocuses, expecially annoying when trying to be used as a telephoto. This is actually incorrect. The lens\' autofocus drive does infact move very quickly, but it must traverse all the way from infinity to about 4"" in front of the lens to find the subject. This is where the wait time comes into effect. Here\'s the solution: utilizing the AF limiter switch allows you to limit the AF search to only between infinity and about 5\' in front of the lens. Consequently, this range is about 10% of the focus range (the other 90% is in between that 5\' and the 4""). I no longer experience AF ""hunting"" problems when trying to use the 180mm as a telephoto.Some other info about this lens:The front objective element is actually concave. I think this is the only L lens Canon makes with a concave front element. It\'s probablyexpensive to replace if an accident should occur, so utilize a UV filter (72mm filter size). I recommend only the B+W or Hoya Multi-coated brands. (Yes they\'re pricey, but worth it)The hood for this lens is actually a little too small in my opnion. If shooting a backlit object, I sometimes get the heavy orange glow in the viewfinder soI am forced to use my hand as a ""hood extender"" and block the sunlight.For its size, this lens is relatively lightweight. It is much lighter than the 70-200mm F/2.8L IS and easily handholdable for extended periods of time.This lens is compatible with Canon\'s extenders. I have personally used it with the 1.4x extender. The results are excellent. While CA and sharpness degrade noticeably on the 70-200mm, this lens shows barely a difference in image quality, except for the change in designation to a 252mm F/5, of course. And add to the fact that the macro capability is now gone from 1.0x to 1.4x, a big bonus.So for whom does this lens apply?-Those who neither have a macro or a telephoto prime who desire a single piece that can handle both aspects with excellent results.-Those who plan on performing professional product photography.-Those that are looking into serious nature photography (packing this lens with a wide-angle is pretty much all you\'ll need on a day hike).What this lens does not do well:-Low-light photography.-Event photography.-Landscapes.Alternatives:-60mm/100mm: lesser image quality, less telephoto compression in macro images, no real double-duty as a telephoto, but a whole lot cheaper and wider aperture.-MP-E 65mm: much greater magnification (5.0x), lower image quality, no telephoto capability, odd design means studio use almost exclusively',)"
"('I bought this lens hoping to upgrade my architectural photography method from shooting wide with the 17-40L and then applying perspective correction in photoshop and cropping. My reasoning for such upgrade was that shooting wide and applying correction wasted much needed resolution, added distortion, and made the scene look slightly different than my intended final scene.Therefore I got this lens hoping to put an end to all of that and get the image to its final crop in camera. Sad to say, that didn\'t entirely happen. This lens has disappointed me on three very important aspects: soft corners, vignetting, and chromatic aberration.SOFT CORNERSBy far that is the most disappointing aspect. Pictures are unacceptably soft in the corners and no I am NOT referring to corners of pictures captured with the lens shifted by 12mm or tilted 8 degrees. I am talking about 0 tilt and 0 shift. In such setting the 24ts-e compared terribly to the 17-40L. Pay attention to the last part, this lens could not keep its own vs a zoom, and one of cheapest L zooms from Canon for that matter.I have uploaded several comparison shots for you to see. To answer some speculation in advance, however, no I do not have an exceptionally bad 24ts-e lens or an exceptionally good 17-40mm lens. I can confirm this because I posted my test results to other photographers on a respected photography forum. The feedback I got was consistent, the 24ts-e performs poorly in general and my lens exhibited the same poor performance.VIGNETTINGGoing past 6mm of shift the lens will start to vignette. By 12mm, which is the maximum shift possible with this lens, the vignetting becomes pretty bad. This is especially problematic for a lens that is made for stitching images. Pictures taken to be stitched at medium to maximum shift will not match in luminosity. In fact, Canon has the 6mm-12mm shift range labeled in red. I guess that is their way of saying you should not use that range. That practically throws away half of this lens shift capacity.CHROMATIC ABERRATIONThat is the least offending aspect but still annoying (check the picture with the window labeled ""bottom right"") I can live with this problem because CA correction software can compensate for most of this problem, but who needs extra steps in post processing when working professionally under deadlines and high quality requirement to deliver?Given this last problem alone I would have given this lens 4 stars. However, with the other two, more serious, problems I cannot give it more than 2.5 stars and thus the two star rating.So should you get this lens? People using average lenses such as the kit lens, 28-135, or 28mm 2.8 might not notice any of the problems I mention because they are used to such results. In such case the new mechanical features are a welcomed plus. That being said, given the lens price I would say its not a good lens to buy. If Canon, however, was to discount the price of this lens I still would discourage buying it. Most people looking for tilt and shift usually need better quality results than this lens can deliver.',)"

"('I\'ve been using this lens on an APS-C body (7D) for a year now.  This lens has been reviewed rather extensively, so I\'ll try to keep this short and make a few points I think are valuable.First, f/1.4.  It\'s awfully nice to have a lens this fast, whether it be for depth of field or shooting in low light.  It\'s worth mentioning that if you\'re planning on using this lens to shoot indoors at extremely wide apertures, you should be aware that although you may get the shutter speeds you desire, you\'re going to have to work very hard to nail the focus, especially with moving subjects.  f/1.4-2.8 or so produce extremely shallow depths of field, and getting it right is not a walk in the park.  This isn\'t a fault of the lens.  You should simply be prepared for what it means to shoot at these apertures.  (I get the feeling a lot of folks buy this lens to shoot people with indoors without a flash, and it\'s no cakewalk.)  Also note that the lens is pretty soft wide open, is good by f/2 and is pretty much a tack by f/2.8 and above.Second, the auto-focus.  In low light at wide apertures the AF on this lens isn\'t great.  It hunts quite a bit and takes some time to acquire focus.  This is probably partly because the DoF is so shallow, but I feel it\'s also partly a shortcoming of the lens itself.  If you put a protective filter on this lens make sure to get a good quality multi-coated one.  I noticed that the already spotty low light AF is worse with a cheap filter.Third, build quality.  This lens is about par for the course for Canon non-L lenses.  The overall build quality is good.  I wish the front element didn\'t telescope with focus, and the AF ring feels fairly cheap in comparison to, for instance, the EF 28mm f/1.8 or the EF 20mm f/2.8.  Overall it\'s OK though, and nothing to be particularly concerned about.Finally, the functionality of this lens.  I cannot comment on performance on full frame bodies, but people looking for the ""nifty-fifty"" field of view on an APS-C lens really need to take into consideration the 1.6 crop factor.  This lens is essentially an 80mm lens on an APS-C body, which puts it into telephoto territory.  Keep this in mind if you\'re planning on using it indoors, as you may not be able to get wide enough.  An excellent solution to this problem is the EF 28mm f/1.8, which is similar in size and weight and also is a fast lens.  The 28mm becomes a 45mm on an APS-C body, putting it closer to the traditional 50mm field of view.  On the flip-side, this lens becomes an excellent length for portraiture on an APS-C body.  So if you\'re shooting on an APS-C body consider what you really want to use this lens for, and then decide if 50mm is still the right focal length for you.Overall a nice lens.  AF is OK, not great, as is build quality, but considering the image quality and price point there\'s nothing here that should really turn you off.  If the focal length works for you, go for it.  And keep in mind you\'re going to have to put in some work to get results at f/1.4!edit 6/25/12:  just a quick note - since writing this review i\'ve moved to a full frame body, and this lens has really come into its own.  it\'s fantastic on a full frame, just an absolute tack.  i love it.  build quality still leaves something to be desired :)',)"

"(""OK, here's the sneak peak on the Target CH-DVD 320S, which I  assume is the same as the CH-DVD 300S that everybody else is selling, but with a different model number to protect those &quot;low price guarantees&quot;.  As you will see, the firmware for this unit clearly identifies itself as &quot;300&quot;.I hooked up the player with the S-video output (it also has component), and the coaxial digital audio (it does not have opticial).First, &quot;close tray&quot;, &quot;menu&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, does lead you to the screen where you can set region coding.  I don't know if it works or not, since I only have region 1 disks.  Also on that screen is a complete run-down of the HW and FW.  I would be interested in what a CH-DVD 300S reports here.  The CH-DVD 320S reports this:MPEG FW  300.B.20.AMPEG HW  DB-B2-V01SERVO FW  CB36260SERVO HW  D07V1.1_VEND  HYOP300UVENDVER  208.FI put Terminator II in, my standard dual layer test disk. Video quality seemed a tad poorer than I was used to, but not objectionable to this mere mortal.  I saw very very occasional minor tearing of the video, and the audio seemed just slightly (but no objectionally) out of sync.  It reminded me a lot of what I've seen from PC DVD players. Its going to be fine for the wife's bedroom TV.Then I stuck a DVD-R that had been &quot;backed up&quot; using DVD XCopy.  As Arnold says &quot;No Problemo&quot;.  I don't have any DVD+R blanks, so I was unable to try a DVD+R.Then I grabbed a CD-R that I had made that contained an MPEG-1 video stream.  Mind you, this CD-R is *not* in VCD format.  Its just a ISO-9660 data disk with a file on it &quot;dsdsads.mpg&quot;.  The player gave me a file browser menu, and when I selected that file it played the video.  AFAIK, this is great because its a lot harder to master a proper VCD than it is to just dump an MPG file onto a CD-R.Then I grabbed a CD-R with some .mp3's on it that I got from a person on this list.  Again, I got the file browser menu.  But when I hit play, the audio played at 2X speed.  The MP3's on thisdisk were mastered at 64kbit/sec.  So don't do that.Then I grabbed a commercial MP3 CD that I bought from BooksOnTape where the MP3's were mastered at 128kbit/sec.  No problemo.Then I grabbed a homemade MP3 CD-R (Pink Floyd, the greatest band ever) where the MP3's were mastered at 128kbit/sec.  No problemo. I didn't have a VBR MP3 disk handy, so I did not test that.Then I grabbed a CD-R full of .JPG's.  It gives you the file browser window and when you hit play it does a slideshow with those.  Nice.The manual does not mention DiVX/MPEG-4 support, and I didn't have a DiVX disk handy to see if its there as a secret feature.I ran out of time, and had to wrap this thing back up since its an XMAS present.The only real question on these is &quot;how long before they go belly up&quot;?  I've had a high end Sony and a mid-range Philips DVD player die on me already (I was an early DVD adopter).  I came to the conclusion that its stupid to pay big bucks for a player that won't last anyhow.  If this one lasts 1 year, I will be happy."",)"
"('This print server shows great promise but delivers nothing but frustration.After following the provided instructions for Mac OS X, System Preferences was apparently able to recognize and set up the printer, but I still couldn\'t print to it. When I clicked ""Print"", I just got a message saying the computer was trying to connect -- for many minutes -- with no response from the printer. So I went back to the printer\'s web configuration page, which seems very nice in theory, but is completely unhelpful. The manual says the print server only works in ""Ad Hoc"" mode, but the configuration page has options to connect in ""Infrastructure"" mode. I have a vague sense of what the difference is between these two modes, and I know how to switch between these kinds of networks, but my vague sense and basic networking skills did me no good because it doesn\'t matter WHAT mode the printer is in -- it never prints.Wait -- that is not exactly true. It prints one thing: the test page. Yep. When you\'re in the configuration web pages, you can click ""Print Test Page,"" and it actually will. Fantastic! But that\'s where the success stops. It prints NOTHING other than the test page. Unfortunately, D-Link tech support politely informed me that if the test page prints, the print server works fine and I just don\'t know how to set up the printer. I should contact Apple  to find out how to set up a printer, they said.Excuse me? If ONLY the test page prints, the print server does not work fine. I attempted to sway them with my  logic, but I was unsuccessful. ""Thank you for calling D-Link,"" they said. I hung up.The most irritating part of the whole ordeal was the e-mail I received from DLink the next day. It was a summary of my call:""- Logged into the DP-311P""- Printed test page (successful)""Matthew has successfully printed a test page.  Resolved.""I responded:""I want to make sure you know that my technical support phone call was incredibly unhelpful. I had managed to get the test page printing from the configuration web site on my own, but the print server was totally unresponsive when I created an IP printer in Mac OS X. I waited thirty minutes to speak to David, who then informed me that he couldn\'t do anything for me because D-Link can\'t help past getting the test page to print in configuration mode.""Well then what\'s the point of technical support? Simply getting the test page to print is NOT what most users want to do with their print server. I have years of experience working on Macs and I know how to set up a printer; that is not the issue. The issue is getting the D-Link to communicate with the printer under normal circumstances. Unless I can get this fixed, I will be forced to return the print server.""I received no response to my e-mail. After 2+ weeks of tinkering around with various computers, various networks, various settings, and various routers (including a D-Link router), I have Officially given up. I am returning this print server to the store, and I shall do everything possible to avoid buying DLink again. I recommend all reasonable users do the same.',)"

"('I got this lens as used through Amazon market place for D700, from KEH. It didn\'t come with a box, manual etc, but the lens looked like a new and works perfect.Tamron 28-75 2.8 is one of the most popular 3rd party lenses and I\'m pretty sure everyone reading the reviews on this page already have read a lot of other \'eviews on the web. I did that too, and here\'re my impressions from about couple of month of readings of reviews on the web.1. It\'s light and compact2. It has decent center resoulution, but borders are soft especially in wide aperture\'.3. sample variation (QC not so good)4. AF is slow.5. Cheaply made, too much plastic.6. Still pretty good lens considering its price (1/3 of Nikkor 24-70)Here are my experience regarding the points above.Before that, I\'d like to let you know that I\'m using this lens with Nikon D700, FX format camera. This lens on DX cameras will give you much better experience.1. Yes, it\'s light and compact. It\'s the lightest mid-zoon lens available for Nikon on the market. 1/2 weight of Nikkor 24-70 and 2/3 of Sigma 24-70.The size and weight of this lens make it a perfect solution for people who need a compact lens for everyday use, but don\'t want to constantlychange prime lenses. Probably the weight of this lens combined with the bodies like d300 or d700 is the maximum weight to carry for someone with other bags to carry. Nikkor 24-70 combined with D700 is almost 4 lb.2. Resolution is pretty good, IMO, especially at wide end. Reviews on the web point out that this lens suffers from border softness, but I\'m using this lens on FX format camera and no problem on border sharpness from f4. At f2.8, center is still pretty good and border sharpness is not usually important for the shots taken with f2.8. However, mine is quite soft even at center at around 50-70mm focal lengths, even at f4. It\'s not terrible, but still noticeable. It can be just mine because most of reviews on the web says center resolution is excellent for all aperture and zoom range.3. I haven\'t tried other copies.4. I disagree with this. Mine is BIM (built in motor) version, which is konwn to have a slow AF, but mine focuses pretty fast. I have no complaint about Af  speed. Compared to 50mm f1.4D which is known to have a fast AF, Tamron 28-75 is not siginificantly slower than 50 1.4D. Again, it\'s for my copy and there may be sample variation.5. agree/disagree. If someone have seen Nikkor 24-70, it surely is cheaply made. It uses a lot of plastic, which makes it light, but I wouldn\'t say it\'s cheaply made. Also, lens mount is metal unlike some other ""cheaply made"" lenses.One gripe is that the zoom ring is little loose. If you don\'t lock the zoom ring (at 28mm) and walk while holding the camera, you may fine the zoom ring at around 50mm.6. Yes it is. Even if you don\'t consider its price, it\'s still a reasonably well performing mid-zoom lens. It may be the only solution for a compact mid-zoom lens for Nikons. If you can give up constant f2.8, there might be other lenses to consider, but if you need a compact mid-zoom lens with constant f2.8 for Nikon, it\'s for you.Even if there are some weaknesses, it\'s 1/3 price of Nikkor. I recommend this lens for amateur photographers who look for a compact mid-zoom lens.If you are a professional photographer, probably you wouldn\'t even open this page : )',)"
"(""I have never bought a non-Canon lens because I just love the look, feel, and optical quality of the Canon line particularly the L series lenses.  But I kept reading glowing reviews about this lens.  On multiple websites.  So, I went out and took a look.First impression:  the build quality is not as good as a Canon L series lens.  Duh!  It costs about 1/4 as much for goodness sake.  This is a plastic lens - not metal.  But I must admit that the build quality was pretty darn good.  Better, I think, than the Sigma lenses I've seen.  Fit and finish was very nice and tight.  I'd give the build quality a 4/5.  Not bad.  I figured I could live with it.Next, I put the lens on my camera.  I'd read reviews complaining about the speed of the focusing.  It may not be quite as quick as my 200 f2.8 L series lens but it was pretty darn good and for my purposes, plenty fast.  A 4.5/5I'd read reviews complaining about the noise and the fact that the AF was not USM.  I thought the AF worked very quietly.  Not at all distracting and barely discernable.  Noise - not an issue.Then, I took pictures with the lens and I was absolutely floored!  How in the world did Tamron manage to produce a lens that performed so well optically for such a reasonable price?!  Beautiful contrast, excellent resolution, gorgeous colors, and extremely sharp, particularly above f2.8.  But, f2.8 is very good as well.Obviously the first comparison that comes to mind is between this lens and the Canon 24-70 f2.8 L.  I would say, I kid you not, that this lens is in every respect optically the equal of the Canon or better than the Canon.  I could not believe it.I tested this lens directly against a brand new copy of the Canon 24-70 f2.8L.  Method: I tested both lenses on a tripod @ F 2.8 and 8.0 @ 28mm 50mm and 70mm. Target limestone wall 9.5 feet parallel to the sensor plane. Remote release employed. No mirror lockup. Center and all four corners were evaluated to my naked eye on a monitor using 100% crops. Both lenses were new copies received within the last 7 days.The limestone wall lent itself perfectly to evaluating sharpness and subtle contrast and color rendition. There was enormous detail present in the wall with subtle colorations present.Findings:28MM F8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners28MM F2.8: Tamron definitely sharper in the center and corners50MM F8: Tamron slightly sharper in the center and very slightly sharper in corners50MM F2.8: Tamron slightly sharper in center and equal in corners.70MM F2.8: Canon sharper in center and at corners. Incidentally noted was inability of Tamron to focus as sharply as I was able to achieve with manual focusing.70MM F8: Tamron sharper in center with Canon slightly sharper in corners.Some have said that there is less flare with the Canon, but if you use the lens hood that should not be a problem.  I didn't notice excessive flare in my copy.Admittedly there is significant copy to copy variation in both the Canon and the Tamron, but my findings convinced me that at 1/4 the price, and with the Tamron weighing 1 pound less than the Canon that the Tamron was the lens for me.  Optically 5/5!!I cannot recommend this lens highly enough.  It is the first non-Canon lens I have owned and I am thrilled."",)"
"(""The Tamron AF 28-75mm f/2.8 delivers sharp pictures regardless of which focal length or aperture size you use.Pros----- Sharp Closeup and Portrait ShotsThe lens is capable of capturing amazing details in closeup and portrait shots. I use an XSi with this lens and it unquestionably sharper (albeit only by a hair) than the kit lens (Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6) that comes with my XSi.- Constant f/2.8 F-StopI love the f/2.8 constant f-stop. It take most of my shots during my hikes. A wide open aperture is a  definite plus because I take a lot of my shots (i) handheld (which necessitates a fast shutter speed to reduce handheld motion blur) and (ii) in lowlight conditions (which necessitates a wide open aperture such as f/2.8)- Solid BuildThe lens definitely has a good heft to it. It doesn't have the light and plasticky feel of the Canon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6.Cons----- Zoom CreepThe lens has pronounced zoom creep (which means the lens barrel extends under its own weight when the the camera is pointed downward). There is a zoom lock, but it's for locking the barrel at the 28mm position only.- Slightly Slow AutofocusLike the kit lens of the XSi and T1i (Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6), the lens has a little trouble autofocusing in lowlight conditions.- No IS (Image Stabilization)There is no image stabilization to counteract any potential handheld motion blur. You would have to compensate with a faster shutter speed. (The rule of thumb on shutter speeds is the shutter speed should be at least the reciprocal of the focal length. For example, if the focal length is set at 28mm, the shutter speed should be at least 1/28th of a second; if the focal length is set at 75mm, the shutter speed should be at least 1/75th of a second.)The lack of IS is definitely a concern for handheld shots if you need greater depth of field (DOF means both the background and foreground are in relative focus), which is accomplished with a smaller aperture size (a smaller aperture translates into: less light to the sensor => the need for a slower shutter speed => potential handheld motion blur).- Len CapThe lens cap is a little tricky to put on the lens (you have to squeeze the spring-loaded sides first as you put it on the lens. Once on the lens, it doesn't always stay on; mine sometimes pops off on its own while in the camera bag.Zoom Range Considerations-------------------------The 28-75mm is the focal length specification on a full frame camera, such as the5D. But on a camera with a 1.6 crop sensor (e.g. theXSi,T1i,T2i,XT,XTi) the focal range is in effect 45-120mm (1.6 * 28 ~= 45 and 1.6 * 75 = 120). This lens would thus not be best suited for wide angle shots on a camera with a crop sensor -- that's an important consideration if you're getting this lens for a camera with a crop sensor. Still, it is quite useful as a walk-around lens, especially if you're primarily taking closeup shots.---This lens is a good lowlight lens. The lack of image stabilization is compensated by its constant f/2.8 f-stop (which allows for a faster shutter speed to help reduce handheld motion blur). All in all, it's an impressive lens that delivers very good image quality."",)"
"('I wanted something for my wife and me to better manage our TV viewing, yet I\'m completely against paying a monthly-fee for recording TV programs. The Toshiba SD-H400 with TiVo Basic turned out to be a perfect product for us, until Media Center PCs go mainstream.I didn\'t really need another DVD player at home (we already have 5 other stand-alone DVD players), but if that\'s the only way to get TiVo Basic service, so be it. Plus, the price I paid for this Toshiba (no rebate) is only (a bit) more than a stand-alone Series 2 TiVo (after rebate). For (the money), I got a progressive-scan DVD player, progressive output for TiVo, AND free life-time subscription to TiVo Basic service. What a bargain.TiVo Basic Service:Okay, so I don\'t get the Season Pass feature. However, once you\'re set to record a show (say, Friends at 8PM this Thursday), you can navigate to the To-Do list and select that program, and change the recording option to ""Repeat this recording"". Change it to weekly, then you\'re all set. The only risk if that if NBC changes the time of Friends to 9 due to say the State of the Union Address, then you\'ll record 30 minutes worth of a bunch of people clapping at nothing. But that\'s a risk I\'m willing to take.One feature I don\'t get with the Basic service is the show search feature. However, we got the TiVo to help with managing the shows that we KNOW we want to watch. With young children, we really don\'t have time to watch the programs that we didn\'t want to watch in the first place but are suggested to us. So I won\'t miss that feature. For new movies we have had Netflix 4-disc service since 2000. You can always navigate using the program guide to set up recording if you want to watch something.If you visit TiVo forums such as tivocommunity.com, you\'ll see that other TiVo owners complaining about the fact that you can no longer use TiVo Series 2 for anything, including manual recording, without paying the (monthly) fee. With the Toshiba SD-H400, not only you can use it for manual recording, you have a 3-day program guide available to you over the phone or wireless network.If the Plus features are important to you, then you can always upgrade to the full TiVo feature for the same fee as a stand-alone Series 2. It goes without saying that we have no intention of upgrading.To get program guide via wireless network:My Toshiba came with version 5.1.1 of the TiVo software, but version 5.1.1b is required for the newer version of the Linksys USB Wireless Adapter (v 2.8). It took a few tries to download the new version of the TiVo software. It would have done it over night, but I was impatient and wanted to pull the sw manually. Note that landline is required to get the software upgrade.To record one channel while watching another:I can watch a different channel than the one I\'m recording because I split my cable signal so that one cable goes to the Toshiba and one goes to the TV. While recording on the Toshiba, I can use the regular TV remote to switch to other channels.Any cons?Remote: The Toshiba remote is not as nicely designed as that of the TiVo, which had just been recognized by the NY Times as one piece of industrial design mastery. The Toshiba remote is long and hard to use if you change channel via numeral buttons often.Wireless adapter: Since the TiVo software it comes with is version 5.1.1, it does not support the newer versions of the Linksys USB wireless adapter (I got a v. 2.8). You will need a landline to download a new TiVo software to upgrade to version 5.1.1b for the Toshiba to recognize your network adapter.Video extraction or copying: Like the stand-alone TiVo Series 2, there is no easy way of extracting the recorded video from the Toshiba device without opening it up (voiding the warranty) and load some files onto the base Linux operating system. The only other way is to video capture (analog cable to digital to analog to digital again) it back into a PC. Not the most elegant solution.Upgrade: according to TiVo specialists at Weaknees, it\'s not simple to upgrade the HD on the Toshiba. You can replace the 80G HD with a larger one, but it will not see beyond the first 80G. Weaknees is working on a solution.',)"

"('This was a gift, and although I would no longer pay full retail price for it, it performed flawlessly throughout the long summer of a bed-ridden friend\'s recuperation.  The screen, which uses a passive rather than active matrix design, does not have the sharp, detailed picture of today\'s laptops and HD monitors but proved more than adequate for movies and ideal for cartoons.  (The onboard speakers, while lacking in bass, are clear and loud--and earphones are included as an option.)  Moreover, if used as a player rather than self-contained unit, it\'s capable of producing a big screen picture and sound equal to, if not better than, the best DVD/CD players.  Never once did it fail to play a commercial DVD or CD (better than I can say for even a Sony and Panasonic that I\'ve owned).  It\'s made of solid and sturdy metal (not plastic) and is definitely superior to the low-grade brands I\'ve wasted money on (Apex, Mintek, Colby, GPX, J-Win) or, for that matter, some of CyberHome\'s own conventional, dirt-cheap DVD players that were no bargain even at $30.This model would occasionally ""scare"" me with an apparently dead screen, but it always proved to be a false alarm (if you switch it to player/AV mode, the screen will go black).  It\'s not made for rough and tumble treatment by kids fighting over it in the back seat of a vehicle.  Approach it with patience and respect, and it will reward you with years of good service.  I was never able to get the advertised 4 hours on a single battery charge, but 2-3 hours was easily do-able, depending on variables such as loudness and brightness settings.  (My laptop does no better.  When possible, I used the CyberHome for extensive periods running off AC power.)The compact design and build quality of the unit have to be seen to be appreciated.  I\'ve read that CyberHome is out of business because of using patents (from Phillips) for which they did not have legal rights.  In this case, the company\'s misfortunes could be to the benefit of the consumer, should you still be able to find a steeply-discounted, desirable product in the company\'s equipment line.',)"

"(""This is one of the smallest shortwave radios in the world. It is THE smallest shortwave that I know of that has a digital readout. If you are thinking of buying one let me list the pros and cons:Size: This really will fit in your pocket. It is a bit larger than an audiocassette in length and width and about an inch and a half deep.Features: Sleep timer, alarm function, 12 hour (rather than 24 hour) digital clock, adequate back light (works well enough to see in a very dark room), larger digital display than most small radios (you won't need to put on your glasses to tune it), tuning light, FM stereo light comes on when you have headphones plugged in, excellent old transistor radio style fold over cover with holes to let the sound out, a bevel stand. The radio was easy to set up for time and alarms. The instruction manual was easy to understand. There is no adaptor but I can't imagine needing one for a pocket radio. Two batteries should last many weeks of heavy use. There is an on and off switch which is a plus as most radios use the volume dial for on and off.Pros: Shortwave reception was tested after 7 PM when signals are strongest here in SE Florida. I was able to get all the big interanational broadcasts. BBC came in as clear as a bell as did Canada and Voice of America. I received lots of other broadcasts in various languages on the 19, 31, and 49 bands. I was happy with its SW capabilities. It won't do for chasing down weak signals but I am not into SW enough to bother with those. Please look up frequencies at a good SW internet site in order to find broadcast times and frequencies. If you are new to SW there is a learning curve as SW broadcasts change frequencies and signal strength throughout the day and night. It is a great hobby but a few quick lessons will make your introduction much more rewarding.AM reception was slightly better than my other portable radios.FM stereo through headphones was very good.The speaker itself gives good sound. There are no bass or treble adjustments but the sound sounds equally balanced. The speaker will not fill the room with sound but this is a pocket radio not a desktop.Cons: The volume dial is on the left side - not the most ergonomic site for right handed folks. The tuning is on the right side. This has a digital readout but an analog tuning dial. I like that as you can tune much more accurately than with analog displays (where you are never sure where you are tuning to). One problem with the G1000A that I bought is that the tuning was &quot;drifty&quot; on SW and AM. This means that I will tune to - say - 97.9 and it would slowly slide off to 97.6 sometimes. I would need to retune the station once in a while. It isn't a big deal and may be a result of being a new radio but it is a small negative.Altogether, I am very happy with this pocket AM/FM/SW radio. It fits perfectly in my briefcase and I am happy with the performance. 4 stars!"",)"

"(""This is a beast of a lens that can create some incredibly sharp images. Bolted to my Canon 7D (an APS sized sensor) this works out to be a 480mm f2.8 (35mm equivalent) lens. I have never seen images this sharp in my life.My primary use for this lens was football, night games. I now completely understand why professional sports photographers own this lens; it worked as easily in daylight as under stadium lights.I'd like to share bit of advice for the person considering this lens for football photography. This is probably way more lens than you want. With an APS sensor, like those on a Canon 7D, 60D, or the Rebel digital line, the telephoto is really too extreme. I found myself backing way off to get decent pictures, more like 30, 40, or 50 yards. The 200mm f2.8 USM with no image stabilization is an inexpensive (compared to this lens) alternative. I would guess that the 200mm f2.0 IS lens is more expensive but probably just as amazing as this 300mm. The 70-200mm f2.8 IS zoom is probably a good lens, but likely gives up some sharpness.You absolutely have to use a monopod with this lens, at nearly 6 pounds for the lens alone; it is hard to imagine holding the camera steady enough under stadium lights. And then let's not talk about the muscles required to hold this thing up. I did discover why professionals put their left hand on top of the lens instead of holding the monopod handle; it is much easier to aim this beast and the weight adds stability to the lens.The focus is wicked fast. I imagine the camera body has a little to do with this speed, but the combination of super fast motors, focus limit switch, and huge light gathering is a major benefit. This speed is a good thing and a bad thing. Whenever a ref ran in front of the camera, the focus is so fast; it almost acquired focus on the ref. The bad part, I don't normally take pictures of refs, and would prefer the players to stay in focus. The good part, if a player is moving fast in any direction, this lens keeps up with focus perfectly.How sharp is this lens? In daylight, I took a waist up picture of a person, essentially filling the frame. I can count the hairs on their arm. An image of a waterlilly, filled about half the frame, with a 3 inch dragon fly on the flower. I can count the barbs on the bug's legs. There is absolutely no chromatic aberration, no blue fringing around white highlights.For something this expensive, even if you have the money, it is a really good idea to rent one of these first. This is a very special lens. I've never seen sharper images and faster focus. But it is a beast; you certainly won't have to lift weights at the gym after lugging this around for three or four hours. It is also a very good idea to read the owner's manual, there are some buttons and switches that are just not intuitively obvious.It appears that Canon has announced a replacement for this lens, lighter weight and a third setting for image stabilization. If this lens goes through a price reduction, it will be a steal (the new lens sounds like evolution)."",)"
"('Bottom line:  Buy it.  Best $12 you\'ll ever spend.I needed to manage a TV, home theatre amp/receiver, DVD player, VCR, Tivo Series II, and a Slim Devices Squeezebox (which emulates a 2nd DVD player).  Wasn\'t ready to take the $100+ Harmony plunge.  Got this baby.  Works fantastic, controls all devices, no problem.  Tivo controls worked awesome.  Had to map my ""2nd DVD"" to the cable/sat button (wish it had an ""aux"" or ""cd"" button instead/in addition to) but that doesn\'t bother me.(FYI: The other reviewer who stated that this remote wouldn\'t even ""turn on"" his Series II Tivo seriously needs to have his brain examined; Tivo is always on, can\'t turn it off.) Trust me, this thing controls Tivo like nobody\'s business.Several great things about this remote:-- It\'s pretty smallish, not huge like some others.  Good heft and feel in the palm, all the main buttons are easily reachable.-- Dedicated Tivo buttons.  I know |&lt;&lt; and >>| can be used for the ""skip back"" and ""skip ahead"" functions, but I\'d rather have the little dedicated Tivo versions of these buttons!-- For $12 you can\'t go wrong.-- This is not a ""learning"" remote, i.e. it won\'t learn IR codes directly from other remotes.  HOWEVER, the groovy thing is that virtually all buttons are freely assignable, either through the built-in move/""punch-through"" feature, OR via the Advanced Codes that you can easily find on the web (see [...] for example.)Upshot is, that while the device was not 100% perfect out-of-the-box, it took me only a couple of hours of button reprogramming, and suddenly this baby was singing, dancing and asking if I\'d like another beer.One small example:  On my remote, the only Tivo button that was ""missing"" was the Display/Info button, to bring up program info, etc.  The ""info"" button on the remote would not work in PVR mode. What\'s up with that?  No problem!  Did little research, then mapped ""Advanced Code"" 635 to the Info button, and VOILA!Can\'t recommend it highly enough.',)"
"('Having owned four Rio Mp3 players in the past and being very satisfied with them all (models S10, S30, S35, & S50) I had good expectations for this newer model but was vastly disappointed with the outcome.  Below I have reviewed every aspect of the player both good and bad for you\'re perusal, first starting with the overall pros and cons in case you don\'t feel like reading the whole thing:OVERALL PROS AND CONSProsExternal lock switch keeps you from digging through menus like other players.Comes with belt clip that most other brands don\'t provide.Allows external memory.ConsControls are too small to use without messing up.Armband sucks and there are no instructions for it\'s use.Instructions are horrible.Sound quality is worse than previous mp3 players I\'ve owned.This version Rio Music Manager Software absolutely is horrible.Software freezes while adding songs.This player automatically alphabetizes the songs on the player..WHY!!?Creating a playlist is a chore and doesn\'t work as good as just adding songs.Playlists are incompatible with external memory cards.Customer service sucks.CONTROLS, DESIGN, & ACCESSORIES INCLUDEDControls & DesignUpon looking at the player I noticed the first problem that would bug me and that was the controls to play, stop, and change tracks.  They are all combined into one little joystick that you move in the direction you want and makes it too easy to hit the wrong one.  This joystick is much smaller than even the average pinky fingertip and I don\'t think is located in a good place to change the tracks without looking (I had to look down at the player closely whenever I wanted to do anything).  This was a disappointment because all the models I owned previously had large controls that were very easy to use without even glancing at the player.One good thing about the controls was the location of the volume button was easy to reach and change since it is not obscured by the plastic carrying case as many models are.  Also, Rio has finally put a lock switch on the top of the player so you don\'t accidentally hit anything to ruin you\'re mood, rather than burying the lock in the menus like other models.Accessories IncludedThis Rio like most models comes with an armband and belt clip, which I find to be both bepretty poorly made.  The belt clip is made of metal that is very tight and I couldn\'t even get it over the waistline of my shorts to use it.  The armband as usual comes with no instructions on how you are supposed to use it (it\'s not like the Nike models that just go into the case on the band).  This is just a velcro strap basically and you are on your own to figure it out..no matter how you go about it though you will have a larger mark on you\'re arm from the belt clip which will dig into you\'re skin the whole time.Another minus is the headphones the player comes with.  As with every other discman, mp3 player, etc. I\'ve ever owned they are very poor sounding and you are going to have to get new ones ( I use the Sony earbud style and they work very well).SoundI found the sound quality of this model to be subpar compared to the other models I have had.  Using the Sony headphones the bass was weak and distorted as was the treble on this thing no matter what I did with the EQ.  Every other Rio I\'ve owned sounded wonderful but this one took a turn for the worse.The InstructionsThe instructions absolutely suck they are about 6 steps front and back of one page that tell you nothing about the product or what you can expect to encounter.  The full manual is on the installation cd, but that is also very lacking in content, nothing was explained about the installation or problems I encountered in using the player.THE SOFTWARE & USING EXTERNAL MEMORY CARDSThis player comes with a different version of Rio Music Manager (RMM) then any other player that I have owned and I found this to be the absolute worst piece of software that I have ever used.  After installing the software you connect the player and expect it to start working like all other models with no trouble.  But, instead it chooses to install itself as a disk drive, and if you are using a memory card it will do the same thing for it thus two extra drives on you\'re computer..can anybody say IRQ conflict?  There was no mention of this in the instructions and I didn\'t know what to do so I let it roll (it was installed as my G & H drive).The actual interface of this version of RMM is more confusing and less user friendly than past versions for a number of reasons.  First, instead of the split screen other versions have (with the songs transferring on the bottom and those you\'re looking for on top) this version only allows you to either see the songs on the player or those on the computer but not both at once.  This is a problem because you can\'t see the transfer status of the songs whereas on the old version it had a bar for each song that went from 0 to 100% as it transferred.  In order to see the status you have to click on the player icon on the left and then let it load the information, and then you don\'t even get a status bar, you just get told what song is transferring.The second problem I had with this software was that on previous versions you could click anywhere in the drop down box on top to choose another folder, artist, etc. but on this version you have to click on the arrow on the right side of the screen for anything to happen.  This causes you to move the mouse to the right every time you want to change folders and a real pain in the rear.The third problem with the software is that about 50% of the time while I was adding songs it would just freeze with no error message or anything, leading me to unplug the player and get a whole lot of errors from the computer.  I tried turning the power management to not shut off for 30 minutes of sitting there but this didn\'t solve the problem... I don\'t know what was wrong here.  And yes before anybody says it I did reformat the player and try adding the newest firmware and software from Rios website.Using An External Memory CardI have a number of 128 MB SD memory cards and attempted to use one in this player, which led to another problem.  In the RMM window when there is a memory card installed it will show the total size of the memory on the bottom (for me it was 363 MB), which led me to believe that it would put the songs on either internal or external memory on it\'s own for me and save the trouble of loading each.  So I loaded up the player, next thing I know it freezes and I click down there and realize that it has attempted to put 290 MB of songs on the internal memory and about 40 on the external memory card, why I don\'t know.  I have no idea why this horrible software couldn\'t just split it up on it\'s own to make it fit between the two since there was more than enough room.  But if you are using an external memory card you have to load each separately or else it\'s going to freeze, what a piece..The Worst Problem ...ALPHABETIZINGI don\'t know who\'s stupid idea this was, but bar none this is the dumbest thing I\'ve ever seen on an mp3 player yet, and absolutely the determining factor for me to get rid of this player.  When you add the songs in any other Mp3 player I\'ve owned the songs remain in the order you add them when you play it back, not so with this player.  The Rio Cali alphabetizes the songs instead of leaving them in the order you chose them, and not only that it doesn\'t alphabetize them the same way each time.  Sometimes it was by song name, sometimes by artist, and sometimes by album, how it chooses what it wants to do I do not know.  I looked through Rio forums and reviews and saw a number of others having the same problem and don\'t know why a fix has not been released yet.  Please Rio get rid of this alphabetizing bull and let the songs be played in the order I want them, for now the only way to do this is by creating a playlist....which leads to the next problem.Creating A PlaylistSo in order to try and keep the songs in the order I wanted I tried creating a playlist as everyone says to do.  The first problem in doing this is the RMM software has to scan all of you\'re music files on the computer which for me took about 15 minutes (around 2000 mp3 songs), as you can\'t add songs to the playlist through anything except that method.  For me I have my songs arranged in folders by artists, etc. for easy finding and didn\'t need the software to find them for me but I had no choice in the matter.When you go to add songs to the playlist more problems start rolling in, first is that while you are adding them you are told no information on the size of the playlist to know if it will fit on the player.  In order to do this you will have to go to the playlist, then right click look at the information and read the size after each song to make sure you are not over spacewise, what a pain.Next problem, once the songs are in the playlist you can\'t move them around to change the order...why make me to have a playlist if I have to keep the order and can\'t move them around?Another problem is that when you are playing a playlist back there is about a 3 second gap between each song while the player finds it...remember it automatically alphabetizes them even if you are using a playlist you have to go into the menu to play it and then the gap comes in..what fun.And the last problem with the ""solution"" to the alphabetizing problem of creating a playlist is that it does not work when you are using an external memory card.  Read the instructions it\'s right in there that playlists don\'t work when an external memory card is in the player, what bull!CUSTOMER SERVICERealize before you buy one of these that customer service/technical support hours for Rio are 8AM-6PM Monday thru Friday so if you have a job as I\'m sure most people do you will not be able to contact them.  When you do contact Rio support you should also be ready for somebody with a heavy Indian accent and little to know technical expertise about the product, they were of absolutely no help to me.RECOMMENDATIONMy recommendation is to not buy this player and don\'t buy any of the new Rio players until the alphabetizing problem is fixed and they revert back to one of the old versions of RMM or a new version.  I bought this player because I had a Product Replacement Plan from Best Buy and when my S35 broke I had to get something in the store with the voucher money.  I ended up selling this player on an auction site after about 7 hours of trying to make it work for me on the computer and ordering myself another S35 online.  My recommendation is to get one of the older Rio S models and save yourself from a lot of hassle.  Rio if you are reading this please, please fix this piece of you know what.',)"
"('This is a great bag. It has been well thought through for traveling. This bag basically has 4 sections for storing things:1. Furthest back is a compartment for the laptop. This is a well padded section which easily fits my 13"" macbook.  I also like to carry my MB in a neoprene sleeve for extra protection once I get to wherever i\'m going, and this all fits nicely and snugly in the section with about 3-1/2 inches underneath (or on top) to spare, for carrying the charging brick, power cords and other small items.  A lot of people have bigger notebooks, so for an added point of reference, I was also able to fit a 15-1/2"" Sony Vaio - also in its neoprene sleeve, 1-7/8 thick x 14-7/8 long x 11-1/2 wide.  This fit perfectly as well, but if you have anything bigger you will have difficulty closing the zipper and I wouldn\'t recommend this bag for you.2. The next compartment is the camera gear section. This is where the bulk of the storage space resides. Dual full zippers, pull the cover completely open. This is nice. I don\'t like to keep my Nikon D90 on the bottom like in the picture, so I rearranged the very stiff velcro dividers so my D90 faces down on the very top.  This makes it easier to get the camera in-out of the bag for me without having to completely open the zippers. The longest lens you\'ll be able to store using the depth of the bag is about 5"".  For other longer items including my sb600 Speedlight you\'ll need to lay them flat.  The inside is softly/smoothly lined and fully velcro\'d except for about 7"" across the top (under the handle). But with the nice two long pads, and the 9 short pads that came with (my bag at least) you\'ll have lots of flexibility to mixing/matching which arrangement works best for you.  There are also three big zippered compartments in this section inside the cover;The top one is actually two separate ones side by side and one big one underneath.  Each have soft suede little flaps to cover the zipper pulls. Inside the sections each are lined with a rubbery waterproof material, so if you stored something inside that leaked, it won\'t drip into the camera section potentially ruining your expensive gear.3. The next two compartments are on the outside-front of the bag.  The top one has a dual zipper pull, which zips about half way down the front of the bag.  This section however goes deeper inside, to the bottom and fully to the sides of the bag.  Inside here are a couple of sections for your ipod, cell phone, pens, wallet, car keys etc.,  and the sides will expand ~3"" for books, papers etc. ** NOTE here:  I have flown on many different airlines, from the small commuters to the bigger Boeing or airbus jets.  This bag has fit nicely under the seat in front of you on every one, or in the overhead bin in practically every one of them for me (except some really small 1x1 commuters).  Dependent upon how thickly you load this section, you ""may"" have to remove the laptop to get your bag to fit.  Personally I have an ipod, phone, a Kindle, a newspaper and perhaps a couple of magazines, a pen, car keys, and haven\'t had much trouble at all. Just a note, not a problem really, just a testament to how well the bag has been designed size-wise for air-travel.4. The next compartment on the front of the bag has a big velcro flap with about a 7-1/2 x 8-1/2 section.  Nice and handy/no fuss (non-padded) access for easily reaching for airplane tickets, passport, loose change, etc. in a hurry.5. Three other noteworthy items; there is also a heavy duty flap on the front which unfolds extending about 8-1/2"" with a pocket for hooking the bottom of your tripod (or other long item) into. Coupled with two bungee types of connectors - 1-half way up the front of the bag, 1-on the top of the bag, allows you to lash your tripod to the backpack.  Nice idea if you need this, but obviously two things to note due to this geometry, 1- you cant stand the bag upright with the tripod attached, 2-you will need to unhook the top bungee to get into the camera portion of the bag (you can still access the laptop portion).The next noteworthy item is the ""AW"" portion of the bag.  AW means All-Weather.  Underneath the bag is a velcro section which contains an attached elasticized waterproof poncho for your backpack.  It completely covers the bag except for the back straps, so you can still wear it as a backpack.Finally this is a backpack, so there is also a waist strap (for transferring carry weight from your shoulders to your hips), and a chest strap for keeping the padded shoulder straps and load weight balanced on your back and pulled in from the bony corners of your shoulders. Also there are three buckles to keep the bag cinched tight front-to-back (one on each side) and on the top keeping the camera and laptop sections cinched together as well. There is also a really nice rubberized and easy to grip handle on the top to carry the backpack bag style, and two loops (one on each side) for hooking things onto (like a water bottle holder, or handheld item, flipcam, gps, phone, etc...)Last comments..  I like this bag for what it is. When you open the box, you will first notice the weight. It is a very well engineered and fully padded tech friendly backpack, with high-quality zippers, that will not fall apart anytime soon.  It lets me consolidate my computer & camera bags for travel, so it does what it does very well.  With airlines cracking down on carry-on items, this bag is perfectly maximized size-wise to fit on-board so I don\'t have to worry about hand checking one of two bags.  This bag is bigger than it looks. It will hold a LOT of gear which is terrific. But it will get HEAVY.  Be aware of this.  I like to carry everything to where I\'m going and unload the laptop and chargers etc. so the bag converts nicely to a day pack as well for out on the trail etc..  If I\'m just out sightseeing etc.  I usually just carry a camera and maybe one spare lens, so I also bring a less intrusive messenger type bag with me usually (carry-on, or in my checked luggage).  There are a lot of competitors in this hybrid compu/camera bag space, this isn\'t a comparison to those bags because I\'m certain they are equally great, so choose yours, but for me and for the price I have no desire or need to trade this bag for anything else, and would absolutely buy it again.  Good luck, and happy picture taking!',)"

"(""Seems like since Cisco bought Linksys, they halted development on all their products. And linksys products NEED development. Doesn't act as a VPN endpoint because they changed the software to require you KNOW the IP address of your traveling USER. As if dialup/hotel accounts ever give a random address out. (sic).That's annoying and I might have had a little patience if the damned basic router worked. It didn't. If you have a webserver and DNS on the inside of your network being accessed by the public with port forwarding (80 and 53), and your local clients try to access sites on that server by name, the DNS will give them the correct info (the external interface of the router), the router figures out they're on the inside of the network(even though they are asking for the external address), and of course it KNOWS they must want to access the router configuration page.... all the older linksys routers seem to perform this function correctly, and changing the type of forwarding (3 avail in this device) doesn't help.The G band performance bites compared to the weak performance of the wrt54g that I was trying to replace.This product is clearly defective and Cisco should recall every one and send us all coupons for beta testing their shoddy work.This is yet another example of a shoddy LinkSys product in recent times.

"('I have read all the reviews here.  I have also successfully set up numerous types and brands of VPNs where I work as a network engineer.  As soon as I saw that my favorite home brand of networking devices came out with wireless g and vpn in one, I had to have it.  I have at my house:  Windows 2003 Server hard-wired, 2 WinXP Workstations, Playstation 2 with Wireless G Game adaptor (Linksys), and a Sony Clie UX50 w/built in Wireless B.  First of all, all my LAN devices have had absolutely NO issues with connections, port forwarding, etc.  The Wireless G and Wireless B successfully connect every time, even though if both are connected at the same time (a ""flaw"" with a mixed connection is that the protocol automatically drops to the lower 802.11b for all clients... but that\'s a global issue with Wireless G APs).  Then, I have my VPN setup so that I can connect from my parent\'s house, work, and anywhere I choose to.  Since I have tons of experience with VPN setups as well as tons of use with the Linksys/Cisco interfaces, this was a breeze for me.  I don\'t know why there are such negative reviews on this product, it\'s by far the cheapest home/small business setup you can have.  At the risk of sounding like a complete snob, if you are well versed in setting up VPN, then have no fear.

I used to work Tech Support, and as we all know, there may be a few ""bad apples"" amongst the lot, but I can guarantee you that Linksys Support is unquestionably stellar to say the least.

I had one router ""die"" when I attempted to upgrade firmware, and after 5 minutes on the phone, my replacement router was in the mail.

Similar companies with similar products (Microsoft, Belkin, SMC, etc.) simply PALE in comparison.  (Many of my co-workers have purchased other brands, they always come back to Linksys!)Oh, and by the way, Cisco doesn\'t make the Linksys products, they just basically formed a business merger.

"('Update: January, 2007: I simply must comment on the issue of TOC (table of contents) and disc error messages that many reviewers have mentioned. YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THEM OVER AND OVER. I have tried all different brands of music CD-R\'s over the years and no brand, not even the Sonys, is exempt from this happening. Sometimes it happen to 2 or 3 discs in a row (after an hour of recording or so and especially when making mixed cd\'s). It is VERY frustrating and I must say with today\'s computer burning capabilities, it actually makes this unit a less that stellar choice in the home CD burning category. If you are looking for a CD burner, I\'d have to suggest going with a computer because after 4 years of having this I can no longer use it. It just takes too long and the discs experience way to many read/TOC/finalizing errors thus wasting any time you may have spent recording. As a CD player, it works fine, but unless you like wasting hours in front of a component recording just to have it tell you ""Unable to Finalize"" or ""TOC Error"" at the end thus negating all your hard work, use a computer.------------------------------------------------------------------------I used to own a Philips single disc CD recorder which I had to hook up externally to my stereo and make analog recordings between the 2 components. It was a nightmare; Wasted discs, additional track numbers, skipped track numbers, unable to recognize disc if I stopped mid way through the mix, inability to finalize... I was so discouraged I thought I\'d never buy another stereo CD recorder again, but then i took a chance on the Sony RCDW500C.First of all, I have to admit that the instructions leave a lot to be desired. You\'ll find yourself flipping back and forth between pages trying to figure them out and half of it won\'t seem to make any sense, (downsampling, bbs, analog recordings, upsampling, optical input, manual sound levelling, set up screen options yadda, yadda, yadda) so I\'d suggest you actually sit in front of the recorder and actually perform the steps as you read them. If you\'re looking for a recorder that you can hook a cassette player or turntable up to and record old formats, this unit will do that, but you\'ll find there are a lot of settings that can be changed that will make the recorder work differently, so you\'ll have to play with those to determine which is best for your own needs.All CD to CD recording is done internally and digitally from deck A to deck B resulting in excellent data transfer between the discs as long as the unit doesn\'t have ""disc error"" problems which happen quite frequently. I made my first mixed CDR and then recorded it to another CDR with the touch of only 2 buttons and the 2nd CDR duplicated flawlessly. I also recorded a complete CD to a CDR using the ""make disc"" high speed button and was finished in less than 10 minutes. (The make disc function copies songs, full track CD text and finalizes the CDR for you all in one step.)On the other hand, this unit is plagued with problems when it comes to reading and writing on the actual discs. I have stuck vehemently to the suggestion of another reviewer here to stop recording at least 5-6 minutes before the end of the CDR to leave space for the finalizing data track and that has reduced the number of ""Unable to Finalize"" messages I\'ve gotten. If you just start off with the assumption that an 80 minute CDR should actually only record about 72-74 minutes of music, you\'ll be golden. Trying to squeeze that last song in up to the last few seconds of recording time displayed on the recorder may cause finalization problems. As for the ""TOC error"" and unable to read disc errors, well, you\'re on your own for them. I have not been able to figure out any way to reduce the number or frequency of them showing up and overall, I\'d say that about HALF of the discs I\'ve attempted to make end up with some sort of read/write error half way through. ;8^(Another problem I did encounter in the directions is that they state when recording a CD track to the CDR, you first press the record button on deck B (puts deck B in ""standby"" for recording)then press the play button on track A. I found that when doing this, if there was more than a few seconds of silence between the time you press play on deck A and the time the song actually starts, deck B will skip to the next track number when the song starts. (ie. press record on deck B, press play on deck A, if more than 3 seconds pass while deck A is loading, when song starts deck B automatically detects the signal and then jumps to track 2, leaving track 1 as a few seconds of silence on your new CDR)Supposedly this ""setting"" can be turned off in the settings menu, but after turning it to ""off"", it still happened, so to remedy the problem, I found it is better to switch the order in the instructions. In record mode, press Play on deck A first, wait a second or two while the player locates the proper track (you can hear the cd spinning inside faintly while the laser locates the track) then once the ""spinning noise"" from deck A stops, right before the track begins playing, manually start deck B recording. (It\'s pretty simple to do this and after a few practices, it will become second nature.)If you have the time to sit down and get to know how it works and decide which settings you want to set it up with at the start, you shouldn\'t have many problems with this player except the read/write problems mentioned above. and when it works and you\'ll find out it can be a lot of fun.',)"

"(""This is my third mouse in about 18 months. This one will stick around awhile, I think. My last 2 mouses werre Microsoft Wireless mouses - Wireless Optical Blue and Wireless Intellmouse Explorer. Both were certainly adaquete, but had issues: The Wireless Optical Mouse Blue was a small for my hand, and the mouse was jerky. The Wireless Intellimouse Explorer was a huge leap further. 2 Extra buttons, much larger, and much more ergonomic. The mouse was still a little jerky but significantly better.Both Microsoft mouses had a common issue. I was frequently accidently clicking the right button. Some corded mouses gave me this issue too, but it was by far most pronounced on those wireless mouses. So that was a criteria for my next mouse - a better right button. I tried both an MX700 and this mouse (Cordless Click! Plus Optical) and the MX700 had the light touch right button. The CC+O, however, had a vert stiff right button. Not so stiff as to prevent intentional right clicks, but to prevent accidental ones. So if you're like me, and find yourself unintentionally right clicking a lot, consider this mouse.Furthermore, the extra buttons are nice. The Back/Forward buttons, while not tremendously useful, are nice. The real surprise though, was the &quot;Quick-Switch&quot; button located south of the wheel. I assumed it would be useful in games (just having an extra button), but shockingly, it's extremely useful in Windows as well. Clicking it pops up a menu duplicating the taskbar listing the windows that are open. Only - the list is sorted such that it is _extremely_ easy to switch between two windows. The top entry will only change between the active window and the window you're alternating with. It's useful for multiple windows as well, but seems to have been designed for two amongst many.Ergonomically, this mouse is nice (though a bit smaller than my old Intellimouse). There are curved ledges to rest your thumb and pinky on, and to hit the forward/back buttons, an upward twist of your thumb is all you need. I did find my pinky dragged alongside the mouse, but it was less than with any mouse except my Intellimouse.The biggest downside to this mouse is the driver. Both MS mouses let me customize the buttons actions on a per-application basis. In iTunes, or Winamp, for instance, I could make forward/back correspond to next/prev song. Logitech forces this on a system-wide basis. The other thing is that in games, the extra buttons on the MS mouse, back/fwd just showed up as extra buttons 4 and 5. On this mouse, games don't even recognize they've been clicked. The workaround is to go into the mouse properties in the Control panel, and specify Back/Forward/Quick Switch to correspond to keystokes - but here, options on a per-application basis would be far better than having to switch the options going between apps and games.Despite the negative, this is the best mouse I've ever owned. I would only suggest it if you have the right-click problem I do - otherwise, the MX700, though more costly, offer an extra 2 buttons and needs no batteries."",)"

"(""I recently bought a laptop and had to go wireless with my network. I saw the 108Mbps and looked into the routers. I read some favorable reviews and bought it.It auto-detects if there is new firmware available and will install it. Just a tip though... don't do this. I ran into some troubles and Netgear Tech support said to disable this feature.The setup of the router is fairly straightforward. If you have your WAN settings readily available, you should be able to get it on-line without much trouble. It did take a bit to get the wireless up and running because I tried to use the highest encryption available without realizing that this is some sort of pay service. I set it to the basic WEP and my card connected fine.It seems to work fine everywhere in the house. I have yet to test it's limits for distance, but it seems to cover any area around the house where I'd use it.My speed seems fairly good, but it's no 108Mbps. My hardwired systems are quite faster. For my uses the wireless is fast enough, though I do plan to get some test software to see what my real throughput is. File transfers are somewhat slow, but since I don't do much of that from the laptop, it's no big deal.The big issue I ran into was with a firmware problem of some sort that screwed up my port forwarding. If I setup more than one port forward, anything in the list past the first setting was unreadable and unremoveable. If I went to modify the setting, the IPs came up wrong and the name was in gibberish as well as the port numbers. Tech support had me download and manually install an older firmware version. That solved the problem. On occasion, changing a setting brings me to a blank IE page instead of returning me to where I made the change. The changes I make do to take though, so this is not a major problem.Having the built-in four ports is nice because it allowed me to easily plug it into my current setup. It was also nice of them to include a decent sized CAT5 cable so I could mount the device away from my other computer equipment. (EMI is a common cause of connection problems with these devices.)Aside from some minor irritants, this router has performed well enough for me to recommend it. Novice users may have more trouble with it than others. Netgear's tech support is not that great by any means, but it was effective enough for me to get my troubles solved. Be sure to register on-line before you call or you will not be able to get support. This is my first wireless router so I don't have anything to rate it against, but based on my experiences, I had my office order one for their 802 network and so far we've had no troubles with it. (Granted, I knew about it's weak points by then.) I gave it 4 stars, but consider that as really 3.5, based on the tech support. There were a couple moments where I felt I knew more about their product than they did."",)"
"('Went from a SMC wireless B router (decent) to a Belkin G (daily resets)to the Netgear SuperG here. So far for the past week - it\'s been rock solid. I\'ve got version 2 of the unit.The annoying issue that I\'ve yet to resolve is the 108auto setting - which as mentioned here and other places - simply doesn\'t work. Both the 108 PCI and notebook cards we have drop back to the 54g setting and never make it above that.  If you want full tilt 108 you have to tell the router ""108 only"" - then you are good to go. Not a problem as long as you have all Netgear 108 stuff. Forget it if you want to give access to a print server or PDA. If the 108auto feature had worked - I would have probably given the Netgear 5 instead of 4 stars.Range and signal strength in our large home (3400 sq.ft) are very good compared to my previous two wireless routers. As other reviewers have outlined - Netgear documentation quality is about as good as what you\'d find on a microwave dinner.  But hey, very few vendors do a good job of that anyway - so really no surprises in that regard.And how about this?  A review that doesn\'t pass judgement on those whose experience varies with this router?UPDATE: (September 8, 2004) Auto 108g Mode appears to be working now with both 54g and 108g products here - although the desktop PC seems a little buggy still.  I went to the Netgear website and downloaded the latest drivers for the PCI & PCMCIA cards for the computers.  Range - particularly with the laptop has also jumped significantly.  (I don\'t know if including WPA security on the wireless contributed to my success here or not - but at least the neighbors now can\'t be wireless Peeping Toms.)  Brought home a new Toshiba Tecra laptop from work with built in G and got full 54g range and speed. Finally...Sacrifices were still made, though.  My venerable Toshiba 755 PDA has now lost wireless access due to the WPA security.  But I\'m not complaining much since surfing from such a device is hard on the eyes (and wrists) anyway.  Maybe the 108g would work in WEP mode.  I\'m almost too afraid to try now that everything appears to be working!The router still is rock solid.  Maybe had to reset it and/or the cable modem only once since I first laid out this review.On the horizon?  I just heard about the new 802.11n standard.  The superman of wireless?  We\'ll see.',)"
"('For the pittance that this thing cost me (about seventy bucks after rebate, shipped free from Dell) it really provides a HUGE HUGE HUGE bang for the buck.  No, it\'s not audiophile quality but this ain\'t no audiophile price either---and it blows away higher end competitors like the Klipsch and (scoff! choke! gag!) Bose 2.1 systems!PROS:1.  40x2 watts RMS on the speakers, 120x1 watts RMS on the sub...those are staggering numbers for computer speakers in this price bracket!  (Tip: when buying any type of audio, always ignore all slimy advertising tricks like ""Musical Power"" or ""Musical Output"" just compare RMS, that actually means something.)  The result is room-filling, wall-shaking power if you choose to crank it, and flawless, crystal-clear undistorted sound clarity if not.2.  Thundering sub!  Yes it can\'t keep up with a three hundred dollar Polk standalone sub but do you really need that good of a sub for your COMPUTER?  I mostly keep mine at about 25-50% levels and it fills out the low ends nicely of the classical and jazz I mostly listen to.3.  Wired remote with separate subwoofer control...absolutely golden!  Beware the 2.1 systems without the independent subwoofer control, you\'ll be drowning in bass.4.  Sleek, classy design---doesn\'t try to go for that gross ""ghetto"" look, thank God.CONS:1.  Why oh why don\'t they make the satellites with separate binding posts so you can put in higher quality and longer speaker cables???  It can\'t add *THAT* much to the price!!!2.  Midrange is lacking, unless you tweak your software equalizer.  I use Winamp (excellent and clean freeware, BTW) which allows me to do so beautifully.  But I kind of wish the satellites were two-ways with really good crossovers...probably would cost an extra hundred bucks right there, I bet.3.  A short and again (groan!) hardwired remote control cable means that I can\'t have the remote on my desk and the sub sitting three feet behind me against the wall, where it\'ll sound much better than in the middle of the room.  Those of you who don\'t mind sitting facing the wall won\'t have this problem, I *have* to sit facing the door (much better feng shui and work atmosphere, just try it sometime) so it is kind of a pain.Still, easily 5 stars at this price-quality ratio.',)"
"(""I bought these speakers based on other reviews here. The hiss is annoying like others have mentioned. No excuse for that really. Makes for a neat mini-stereo with the wireless remote. Both the satellites and sub are quite large. But they do belt out pretty loud sound. Bass and treble controls are not like typical ones, as they tend to cut the treble sharply across the whole higher frequency range, instead of rolling off gently. sound thin. These went from mediocre to great when I ditched the onboard sound and installed a Audigy 2 sound card. Much smoother and less harsh. Nice if you don't need multi channel."",)"

"(""With fast shooting high mega pixel cameras, the CF card can be a major performance factor. Why have one of these cameras and use a card that cannot keep up? When I bought my 8.2 mp Canon 20D, I decided it was time to get a second CF card so the research started.The Ultra II cards write with a minimum of 9 mb/sec. and read at 10 mb/sec. These fast write speeds are desirable with large image files. There are cameras with buffers to hold images while writing to the card during continuous shots. At some point if the card cannot write fast enough, your camera will stop shooting until the buffer clears enough room.This card has a high impact rating. For example; if you were to accidentally drop this card 10-foot up to then hit the floor, this card is rated to sustain the fall without damage.Sometimes the trade off on price comes from power consumption. Lower priced cards may use more power to do the same job as this card. The low power consumption of this card means a longer battery life.People generally want to know how many images a card will hold. This is a difficult question to answer and greatly depends on both the card and the camera it is used in. The number of images this card will hold on my 20D also depends on the settings used. Let me provide a few settings and image counts for an idea of what this card holds.Shooting Raw w/ISO 100 - 110 imagesShooting Raw w/ISO 800 - 102 imagesShooting Large jpeg  - 239 imagesShooting Medium jpeg  - 413 imagesShooting Small jpeg  - 725 imagesI use both a 1GB and a 2GB card shooting primarily raw images. Sometimes the 1GB card is more than adequate, but other times I could easily fill the 1GB card quickly.  There have been many days where I have taken 200-300 pictures without the opportunity to transfer my images.  The 2GB card not only gives me more storage space, but also permits me to change the card in a slow moment before it completely fills up.  It is truly aggravating to lose a shot because your card filled up.  For these reasons I tend to prefer the 2GB cards.  When considering the card size, one should attempt to balance convenience with capacity. Having one card for all your images may be convenient, but it is also putting all your eggs in one basket.Worried about reliability? It's backed by a lifetime limited warranty outside Europe. The warranty excludes any defects, malfunctions, performance failures or damages to the card resulting from use in other than its normal and customary manner, misuse, accident or neglect; or improper alterations or repairs.PROS:ReliableFast read/writeImpact resistantLow power consumptionBacked by a lifetime limited warrantyCONS:None"",)"

"(""Frankly, i had no idea the difference between noice-cancelling earphones and sound isolating ones. Also, this one was my first Shure - i did know it's a outsanding brand. moreover, i didn't expect too much for a earphone costs less than a hundred bucks.BUT, this one really stands out. First, the package was wrapped tight, don't get me wrong, that's just a way to evaulate the product based on my experience, which is the product inside wouldn't be good if the wrap were frigle.Second, there are 5,6 options of the earphone caps (sorry, i don't know how to say it right, but check the picture, you know what they are) offering different fits for ur ear.And then, i plugged it in my computer and watched the Transformers: The movie once again - i guess it was my 23rd time. and you know what, believe me, I DROPPED my coffee when the Optimus Primes's voice and the theme music kicked in. WOW~ Not bad for the earphone less than 100 bucks. well, to be honest, i should say i must put the earphone in a pretty good position otherwise it wouldn't be that shocking. IT IS NOT EASY to put them into ears correctly, get used to it. you'll be fine after 30 or 50 times practices. ^^Finally, i tried it on iPod (60G Black Video), and i got disappointed for the proformance. Well, i started to blame the iPod thinking about throw it away. But, then i tried play mp3 files on computer, and it sucked too. at last, i realize it is the format issue that mp3 couldn't hold so many datas encoded the wide range of sound, even the config is up to 320kbps... so, i set the itunes importing to Apple Lossless Encode and then ripped my CD collections again. The performance got WAY BETTER. but still, it can't be compared with the ones on CD player, even not comparable with the CD played on computer. I guess i'll have to buy a cd player then~Sum up, it was a wonderful choice. and I bought this one just before the price went down, paid 79.99 for this, but now it's just 50 something. so what'r u waiting for? i'm thinking about the best Shure, SE 530, right now. ^^ (please don't muck me about my itunes usage, rookie mistake, and i just thought my experience might help some other guys out there.

"(""I have owned/tried over 20 different pairs of earbud style headphones. Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, Creative, Phillips, HK, JVC, etc. The sound quality from these ranges from disgustingly bad to pretty good. The best were a pair of $12 Sonys. Good bass, decent highs. These Shure E2's are a whole nother level.I had been looking at taking the next step in earbuds but I thought how good can a set be? And are they worth a $99 MSRP? Yes, yes they are. First of all. If you have not tried a noise canceling or reducing pair of headphones then you don't know what you are missing. It is similar to stepping into a sound proof room. Listening to music at a low level with these noise reducing earbuds turns people around you into mutes. You can't hear them talking. This is great. You will pick up sounds in your music you never knew were there. Incredible. This takes some time getting use to  and this is not for every situation. Jogging through the city, etc. You want to be able to hear sirens, people yelling 'look out!', etc.The sound is clear, crisp, and never fatiguing. The bass is good, but could be a tad better. You can adjust this with the eq in your player. I compaired these with some Ultimate Ears 5EB's and while the 5EB's had better bass response, the Shure's had a better sound stage and cleaner higher frequencies. I would choose the E2's in a hearbeat over the $199 prices Ultimate Ears.One thing to note. These don't fit like ordinary earbuds. They sit deeper in your ear canal. Take some time to find to choose the best fitting end before you complain they don't fit. The small or medium foam ends seem to fit best with most people. Once you get use to putting these in-should only take a few times- you will be amazed at how much better these sound than any ear bud under $100. These destroy anything in their price range and even ones much more expensive.  I would buy these for anyone who loves quality sounding music."",)"
"(""It's been 3 years since I joined Apple's bandwagon, courtesy of 2nd generation top-of-the-line PowerBook G4. Back then, it represented state-of-the-art with 1&quot; thick titanium-finished chassis and 15.2&quot; widescreen LCD, filled with many desktop-like features: 667 MHz G4 processor (up from 500 MHz of 1st generation PowerBook G4), gigabit ethernet (up from fast ethernet), built-in AirPort (was optional), and DVD/CD-RW combo drive (was DVD-ROM or CD-RW only).Two more generations of PowerBooks later (3rd added 1280 by 854 LCD, DVI output, faster graphics, and 800 MHz G4; 4th added 1 GHz G4, faster graphics, and SuperDrive), we get more substantial upgrade. No, this 5th generation PowerBook does not have a G5 processor. Mobile G5 probably isn't due for another year or so (Apple and IBM are busy at work cranking out PowerPC 980).The most radical upgrade has to be aluminum alloy chassis. While not as hip as titanium, aluminum alloy is about as strong as titanium, while looking beautiful and providing one important benefit: nothing's painted over it. Pure aluminum alloy finish. Titanium PowerBooks were notorious for paint chipping off. Now the PowerBooks will stay beautiful year after year. As an added benefit, every keys on the keyboard are painted in aluminum alloy to give more complete metallic look and feel.Other notable improvements include:- 1.25 GHz G4 processor (10-25% faster than 1 GHz predecessor)- AirPort Extreme (802.11g) and Bluetooth- USB 2.0 and FireWire 800- Faster 167 MHz FSB with DDR RAM support- Up to 2 GB of DDR RAM- ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 graphics card- Backlit keyboard- 3 speakersLast generations of PowerMac G4s lacked many bleeding edge technologies (e.g., PCI Express, Serial ATA). And it being a generation or two before PowerBook G5 arrives, lacks some cutting edge technologies as well: high resolution 15.4&quot; LCD, 7200 RPM hard disk, PCI Express card, faster FSB, digital audio I/O, and higher capacity battery with advanced power saving technologies.Until then, you should proudly carry 5th generation PowerBook G4, knowing it is among the most powerful and certainly MOST beautiful notebook on the market.Pros:- Feels very fast (helped by 1.25 GHz G4 processor with large 512 KB L2 cache, DDR RAM, and ATI Mobility Radeon 9600)- Very well equipped -- no additional hardware purchase required (although some will want more memory and/or extra battery)- Simply beautiful... the most beautiful PowerBook yet- Fantastic connectivity options- Light and slim for a desktop replacement notebookCons:- Among the most expensive notebooks in its class- While it feels fast, it is slower than many Centrino notebooks- 15.2&quot; LCD is limited to 1280 by 854 resolution, which is among the lowest in its price range- It is slightly larger and heavier than previous Titanium PowerBooks- Shorter battery life than earlier PowerBook and many Centrino notebooks- Earlier builds are plagued with white spots on the LCD and lid not closing evenly (both issues should be fixed by now)- No docking station option"",)"

"('I was very skeptical buying this gamepad after buying the ideazon zboard.  I had a horrible time programming the zboard, and didn\'t feel it enhanced my game experience whatsoever.  I decided to buy this product purely by word of mouth from other gamers who swear by the n52.This controller I have primarily used to play World of Warcraft with.  The two classes I\'ve played it with are a priest and a rogue.The n52 has a lot of buttons and initially feels very clunky.  The buttons were initially stiff, the scroll button is practically useless and the big orange button would move the entire controller unless I held the entire thing down.  This controller initially felt no different than using a regular keyboard and modifying the buttons to your liking.The innovation of this product though is in the software.  You can install and start programming macros, spamming buttons, character templates, and button combinations with ease.  There wasn\'t any need for me to read the instructions on how to do this; it was that simple.When I played with my rogue I noticed I would down mobs noticably faster since I could spam my combo attacks and finishing moves.  When timed, my overall attack time improved by 1.35 seconds on an even level mob.  I did not try my rogue on a pvp game, just on regular enemies.When I played with my priest, I noticed I could spam spells faster than I ever could before. With the right healing macros in place with the controller macros, I could keep an entire group of people up in battlegrounds and raids with just one button press.  When playing pvp battlegrounds, players on the opposing side ended up targeting me because I was throwing out heals faster than they could terminate the players I was keeping up.  I ended up getting most kills alliance side as well, despite being disc/holy spec (holy priests are known for being squishy).  This is mostly due to being able to spam spells faster than they could heal, or kill me.Actually using the n52 while pvping was at first a challenge because I didn\'t know how to streamline the macros.  While I initially thought the three buttons available for just my thumb was going to be worthless, I ended using them more than ever.  The big orange button has now become my spam/kill button, the d-pad for targeting, and the space bar-like bottom button for jumping.  After streamlining how I wanted my spells and configuration to be, I was owning at raiding and pvping.There are keyboards out on the market right now that call themselves gamer ones (i.e. Logitech, Microsoft).  They have macro command functions similar to this one, but usually the macro keys are in an akward place on the keyboard. Most people don\'t use the macro buttons due to their inefficiency.  This controller despite being clunky, is the only one on the market right now that gives you a easy and time-saving method of programming and adjusting macros and keystrokes to what you want.Despite the n52\'s shortfalls, (stiffness, badly placed scroll button) I have to say that if you are interested in pvp on WoW or any other pvp MMORPG, you should definately look into purchasing this controller.  A lot of the ""legendary"" pvpers are good because they kill quickly and efficiently.  Most people blame great pvpers for being good because of their excellent gear, being a certain class, cheating etc.  All they really do though is use this controller.  It\'s just that good.UPDATE:  12 Dec 2006 - I\'ve been using the N52 for about 6 months now and am completely addicted to it.  I love this pad so much I\'ve bought a couple for my gamer friends.  If they don\'t have one, they already know what I\'m getting for them for Christmas.The pad\'s buttons have gotten a thorough working in.  The stiffness has since worn away form the keys and now feels like a old school nintendo power glove.  I moved the adjustable handrest back, and now use the row below the preforated arrow keys on the pad in order to move.  This gives me a bigger arsenal of buttons to use with less quirky movements and the ability to smoothly use the scroll button (which can be used as buttons as well).  I haven\'t found much use for the programming states, which usually ends up complicating my already complicated set-up.  The orange button still does suck, as you have to hold the controller down in order to press it, though I\'ve learned to adpat my style in order to use it quickly.',)"
"('Here are a few details you should know about the Tetra Hub. You have to buy the darn thing to figure this out.The Tetra Hub must be connected to a USB 2.0-compliant host in order to function in high-speed mode (480Mbps data rate). If the Hub is connected to a USB 1.1-compliant host, it will operate only in low-speed or full-speed mode (1.5Mbps/12Mbps).Note: The Hub itself will always connect to the host as either a full- or high-speed device, never as a low-speed device. Any idiot that tries to use this with an old USB 1.0 PC port will find it does not work, duh! These are the people who write Amazon reviews denigrating a product and they have not a clue as to how it is supposed to function. I really like the one where someone at Belkin tech support said to take it back and go buy someone else\'s hub, i.e. ""GO AWAY!""The Belkin Tetra Hub provides four downstream USB ports that offer backward-compatible, Plug-and-Play connectivity with all USB devices, including USB 1.1 (or low- and full-speed) devices, as well as with USB 2.0 (or high-speed) devices. This includes such peripherals as scanners, printers, mass-storage devices, and high-resolution cameras.The Hub is self-powered if you use the supplied AC adaptor, which allows the cascading of devices with additional hubs, so that up to 127 USB devices may be connected to a single port.The Hub features neat multicolor LEDs that indicate the operating speed of each connected USB device and the speed of the link to the host computer. More on this feature in a minute.The TetraHub offers several important advantages over traditional USB 2.0 hubs. Most important is its implementation of the new ""Quad TT"" architecture. Simply stated, when connected to a USB 2.0 host controller, each of the TetraHub\'s four downstream ports deliver a full 12Mbps of USB bandwidth for low- and full-speed devices while still providing total support for high-speed devices. This is especially important when connecting multiple, bandwidth-intensive, full-speed devices such as USB webcams, speakers, scanners, and external storage devices.BACKGROUNDThe USB 2.0 specification includes three separate modes of data transmission. These are defined as low-speed (1.5Mbps), full-speed (12Mbps), and high-speed (480Mbps).The Belkin TetraHub appears to be the only USB hub on the market today that provides a visual indication of a connected device\'s speed. This is accomplished using Belkin proprietary speed indication circuitry. Each downstream port on the Hub has a corresponding LED that changes color according to the speed of the connected device.Connection Speed - LED colorLow - GreenFull - RedHigh - AmberIn addition, the upstream port has a corresponding LED that indicates the speed of the computer\'s USB host controller.Host Controller Speed - LED colorFull - RedHigh - AmberIMHO this is an unusual USB hub that is worth every penny Belkin gets. I just wish they had built this technology into the 7-port hub that features two ports on top for my flash drive.I do not work in the computer industry or for Belkin. As I look at my desk, I notice I have a few other products from Belkin that have been very ssatisfactory over the last few years. I hope this Tetra USB HUB continues that experience over time.Vic',)"
"('I really like this player BUT it can, at least on some units, develop a problem that scratches your DVD\'s. Not saying you should not buy one... just beware and current owners, be vigilant. I like SONY and they have a boatload of my money and I am being honest in this review.SYMPTOM:Some DVD\'s may sound a little out-of-balance (mechanical rotation sound).  Intermittent play of certain DVD\'s, remove DVD to clean/inspect it and you see one or more half-moon shaped scratches... deep with curled plastic and ""DVD dust"" that has been gouged out of your DVD.I entered a service call with Sony about this scratch issue and they asked me to unplug it for two minutes... oddly enough, this did not solve the problem :) So I opened the player and after viewing about 50 DVD changes... it all became clear.BACKGROUND:To get so many DVD\'s in the unit and minimize the player depth dimension, Sony designed it to NOT totally move the playing DVD into the player section unlike their 300+1 disk changer that I also have.  They leave the edge of the spinning disk inside your storage tray.  To keep the two DVD\'s on either side from getting in the way, a forked-bracket comes out that is supposed to separate/move them away from the spinning disk.PROBLEM:Sometimes the forked bracket that is supposed to move the side disks apart either doesn\'t or FORCES the DVD to the right of the spinning disk into your spinning DVD which, like a saw, grinds away during the entire time you are watching the playing DVD.  Heck, if you are watching Titanic it may actually saw the poor thing in half.  If I wasn\'t serious that may have been a joke.(Note: Original review written in December, as of February, NO MORE SCRACHES since my ""screw"" mod.. See ""MY RESOLUTION"" BELOW)MY RESOLUTION: (Try at your own risk)SONY was of no help and did not admit that anyone had ever reported this (evidence in chat forums tells me this is less than honest) So... I made a slight mod to the back screw of the laser assembly (has a small blue rubber boot over the screw)  Added a thin washer so it points the leading edge of the spinning disk a little to the left and away from the exposed play side of the next DVD.  So far (viewed about 200 disk changes) so good.  BTW, my unit is level, the disk tray is in alignment so that is not it and the forked bracket is tight.  I think this is just a poor design with enough variables in the mechanism that it works ""most of the time"". Some players may never see the issue but mine, and others obviously have.You could send your player to SONY and perhaps they have a solution they are not making public, perhaps not.SONY, shame on you for this design (would rather have a few less  DVD\'s and no chance of damage) and also for not being honest with customers who have reported this.Note: As of 7/31/2013... not even ONE more scratched DVD after my screw/washer mod.Good luck fellow DVD lovers!',)"

My thoughts now? How did I ever live without this? I've used this extensively to travel all through CT and into NH and MA. I love that I can be in a completely remote location and this device gets me home. Ever single time. I also have searched several times for things like gas stations and restaurants - and it is simply amazing. I like this better today than I did when I bought it. And I'm someone who gets tired of their electronic gadgets quickly.Update: August 14, 2005 - I go everywhere with this device. I could not live without it. If it broke I'd purchase another on the same day - it's that important in my daily travels. I've never gotten lost with this. I tried the Hertz system while in Florida and it is similar with a smaller screen and fewer functions.I found it to be very easy to operate. You truly can take it out of the box, plug it in, and within a couple of minutes be navigating to any address using the maps that are all stored within the 10 GB hard drive.When starting up I find that it has a lag of 3 to 5 minutes where it has to acquire the satellite signal. This may account for some of the reports online of units being broken or not navigating properly. Once the signal has been acquired I had no difficulty with it knowing where I was. (Update 12/24/03: My unit developed a startup/fix time of around 15 minutes so I replaced it with a new unit that did not exhibit this problem. Normal startup/fix time appears to be a couple minutes unless you've moved significantly from where you shut down the device).The 3-D navigation is nice -- though not all that I had hoped. When travelling 3D pops up a handly graphical overview of where you need to turn next. I think it is displayed a bit early though. I was navigating today and it showed me the turn in 3D about 5 streets ahead of where I needed to be turning. I'll have to see if it is my user error somehow but it seems it would be much more useful if the 3D popped up while you were in the turn rather than several streets back.I looked at the Garmin 2610 in comparison to this unit. I also considered the RoadMate 500. The Garmin screen seemed smaller and a little harder to operate. The RoadMate 500 is the same unit at this -- without the internal 10 GB hard disk that stores all the maps.Unfortunately the 700 doesn't ship with an AC power adapter or USB connector (which the 500 does).The mount that comes with the RoadMate is a plastic coated metal piece that you are supposed to use to attach the heavy unit to your vents. I lucked out and was able to stick it into my dash molding on my 2002 Ford Explorer and it fits tight and is in a good position (use a flat edge screwdriver to slightly and gently pry the molding above the radio out a little and slide the bracket in there). If you call tech support they'll send a free windshield mount to replace the vent mount.Overall I'm happy with the accuracy and especially the ease of use of this unit. It seems that Magellan has bent over backwards to make this an uncomplicated unit for people who want to plug in and navigate without worrying about loading maps or other technical details. UPDATE 3-29-05: I use this every day and love it. Cannot imagine living without the mapping capabilities. Strongly recommended for anyone who drives alot."",)"
"('If you read the reviews for this device you will notice that half of them are, ""Works Great!"" and the other half are, ""Never worked.""  Now I know why.The first problem with this product is with the drivers.  After spending too much time trying to install the device I went online seeking answers.  It seems that the SP2 upgrade for windows created driver conflicts for this device (which explains why SP1 owners worked great, until they upgraded).  This required you to forcefully update the driver and avoid all automatic detection by manually pointing to the Linksys Driver.  Linsys has a tech support article explaining how to do this on their web site.  Go to ""Easy Answers"" and search for ""USBBT100 SP2"".  Microsoft has a KB article as well.The second issue is in the hardware.  If you were unlucky enough to receive a defective dongle, like me, then you will be in for some frustrating hours of agony.  It\'s not that the device just doesn\'t work... it is that it doesn\'t work depending on the phase of the Moon and the alignment of the stars (not really, but do I need to say that?).  This intermittency of working/not working/half working is what will make you think you\'ve got it working, and then you don\'t.  My opinion here, but after being a lifelong loyal customer of Linksys, I think their third world manufacturing has taken a nose dive here.My second shipped dongle worked fantastically right out of the box (after installing the drivers correctly).  I was making Skype calls using my Bluetooth headset and walking all around the house with great reception.  However, the antenna would not rotate.  I knew that the antenna was supposed to rotate because my previous one did (and the product photo shows it rotated).  I actually broke one of the tiny little plastic nobs that hold the antenna on while trying to rotate it.  Once again... incredibly poor quality control in the manufacturing process.Now, I need the antenna to rotate due to the location of my USB slot.  So, once again I asked for a replacement.  I received this response from Amazon, ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.  We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed.""And last, I would like to mention that Amazon has the best customer service I have ever encountered.  They immediately shipped my second replacement at no cost, gave me no grief, and were apologetic throughout the whole process.  So, if you order this product, know that they will treat you right and take care of you should you want to exchange or return it.',)"

"('If I did not already understand wireless networking and security, I never would have been able to get it working. Yes, it works fine, but I cannot recommend the unit.

"(""In some ways this is the best mp3 recorder I've used.  It's extremely quiet.  It's compact.  Its controls are intuitive.  The rubberized portions of the case help prevent slipping.  The internal microphone does a great job.  It has two major flaws, however, and one is fatal.The non-fatal flaw is that an external microphone requires a preamp.  Preamps are not cheap.The FATAL flaw, which gave me no choice but to return it, is that IT HAS NO SHUTDOWN PROTCOL.  If the battery runs out while you're recording, YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING!!! (Guess who lost an entire evening of wonderful music made with friends.)If Archos would bring out a Gmini with a mic input and a shutdown protocol, you'd find my iRiver ihp-120 and my Sony high density Mini Disc recorder listed on eBay, half.com, or over here at amazon.---------------Added in edit:  I have no idea how to use these things effectively as MP3 players.  I want an effective recorder for music jams, so that's thew perspective from which I'm reviewing them.I've gone through a bunch of options. I've tried the iRIver 320 and 120.  I've got a Sony HiMD mini-disc.  I've been scouring the web for news/rumors of a forthcoming model by *anybody* that would meet all my needs.  The Marantz PMD660 looks promising...for $600 street.  I've given up.I realized that of all of them, the Archos was the best compromise.  While the lack of a shutdown protocol can be disastrous, it's straightforward (two button pushes) to save and start again.  The sound through the built-in mic and the highest quality mp3 microphone bitrate (112 kbps) are adequate.  The convenience of the Archos's drag-and-drop capabilites won out over the HiMD's ability to use an external mic. I'm not trying to approximate the sound of a studio recorder.  I admit I'm nervous about the many failures I've been reading about, but I got another one and this time I'm keeping it.  The current $50 Archos rebate didn't hurt either.When I took it out of the box, the up-button didn't always register, but it seems to be fine with a few minutes of use.  I've still got nearly 2 weeks to return it if it acts up again, but if I end up returning it, it will be for an exchange, not a refund.[...]I sold the iRiver ihp-120 on eBay.  I'm holding onto the HiMD recorder for the moment simply because I can run it off of AA batteries if I need something away from an electrical output for an extended period.  Otherwise, I'd get rid of it, too."",)"
"('I won\'t go into detail about my credentials, but I am a seasoned IT professional who has set up over 100 network printer interfaces and print servers, internal and external, from nearly every hardware vendor out there.  I was able to get this unit to work as per the directions with an Epson Stylus C82 (USB interface) without issue.Imagine my surprise, then, when I could not get it to work with a trusty, corporate standard (last millennium at least) Hewlett Packard LaserJet 5!  Simple parallel interface, high quality Belkin 6\' IEEE-1284 compliant cable, stock Windows XP drivers -- This should have been a no-brainer!Test pages from the web interface worked fine, and the printer was recognized (On-line) but actual print jobs via the Windows driver produced unpredictable, but never functional results.  Only once did the output look at all like the Windows test page, and then only roughly.I was about to give up, when I reread the entire manual and saw information about the ""Bi-Admin"" utility, which is used (among other things) for configuring the bidirectional parallel and other parameters.  This, it turns out, was crucial to getting this printer to work with the device.  Long story short, after I enabled ""ACK & Busy"" for P1 (parallel port) on the ""Configuration -> Physical Port"" menu item, everything worked perfectly.  I tried to enable ECP mode, but it would not save that setting.If you are an experienced user or tech, you should probably read up on how to configure this without their kludgey software driver.  Set it up in Windows 2000 or later as a standard TCP/IP interface using LPR.  Parallel port gets queue name of P1, USB is P2.  Clean, simple, and reliable.I have not even tested the wireless capability yet, but everyone seems to say it works for basic configurations.  Don\'t expect a lot in terms of wireless security (WEP only) but it does the job.One more thing: as many others have mentioned, you should make SURE this device is configured with a static IP address.  If this confuses you, get help from someone who knows what they are doing.  Sadly, this probably does NOT mean Linksys ""Tech Support"" who will likely tell you that they cannot help you determine the settings for your home/business network.',)"

I never got around to testing them on my main stereo system, but I figure its unlikely anyone is buying these for there main system anyway so here it is:Equipment tested with:Systemax pc with integrated sound cardold systemax with an Audigy cardvariety of laptops including acer and compacIlo mp3 player1st gen sony car discmanI have to say many of the reviews on here must have been by people who took them out of the box put them on for 5 minutes and decided the world should hear what they have to say regardless of accuracy.  My first listen was in a room with 3 servers and 3 pcs running, they did a nice job of canceling out the noise but the bass was thin and the upper ends sounded pinched off.  The phone started ringing so I set them down and left the music on to break em in a bit.  After about 5 hours I put them on and gave a serious listen, the bass sounded much better and the higher end much more natural.On the plane they reduced the noise quite a bit, but it was still audible, Really not a problem, I believe they perform as advertised. Contrary to many reviews, JVC says noise is reduced by 12 db at 300hz, not 90% of the audio spectrum.  It really makes the flight much more enjoyable, I picked a seat in the back of the plane since that tends to be noisiest on the little commuter jets and they passed my test, which is my ears arent ringing.  I\'m not a good judge of haedphone comfort because I tend to hate all phones, but these are ok.  I can wear em for 30 minutes or so without readjusting.  the top band could use a little pad but that should be easily fixed.They do introduce noise if you turn them on in a quiet room, but that begs the ?, why are you turning them on?  With background noise overall sound is reduced and thats the point.  They perform quite nicely without the NC on.  They are incredibly easy to drive, my ilo player (which the biggest complaint is lack of volume if you read reviews) drives them easily, and I\'m currently listening to them on my discman on the ""min"" volume setting.  Do not plug them into anything without turning the volume down, unless of course you like pain.If your never going to listen to anything besides 128 kbs mp3\'s these provide all the sound quality you need to be happy.  They are good enough for the critical ear to enjoy them, and to appreciate better sources without being so detailed that bad/low res recordings are annoying.The cord does feel flimsy but snags should be minimal since you only pull out what you need.  Mine have about 10 hours so far on the battery and its still kicking, and they seem to get more comfy as the foam in the pads wears in.  I really havent noticed the differential in sides, I would send em back if you experiance that and try a different pair.These are a really good buy, but if you have to spend more get the sennheisers, at least they dont need separate eq\'ing to sound good unlike another brand commonly mentioned.  If you gotta have the best and have 299 to blow then get some noisebuster\'s for the plane and a pair of Grado\'s for home/hotel, and still have enough leftover for 8-9 cds!!!',)"
"('I posted the following review on the Klipsch forums as well. I suppose it\'s now far too late to get Klipsch to ever admit that there was a problem since the speakers are discontinued and inventory everywhere is almost completely depleted. It is possible to get them ""fixed"" by paying Klipsch about $100 and waiting 6-8 weeks...but Klipsch doesn\'t actually fix them, they just replace the defective part and send it back to you. The flawed design is still destined to fail every single time.==============================================I bought mine 2nd hand off of a friend who was moving to another county and didn\'t want to carry speakers across the ocean with him. Before I bought them I listened to them very carefully for about 10 minutes to make sure all channels were workinig and clean...even blasted it for a few minutes to see if there would be any thermal shutoff. Nope. They sounded great and he gave me the friend discount -- $100 for the whole package.When I purchased I was aware of the high failure rate and the overheating problems. I figured that a) the truly damaged amps were lemons, and it wasn\'t actually a design flaw, and b) most people blowing their amps were probably listening at very high levels. I thought I could dodge the issue by being a responsible owner.So for four months I kept my speakers around 50-60 *maximum*, and I always turned them off as soon as I was done listening. Well last week after watching a movie and falling asleep, I woke up and forgot to turn the unit off, dashed off to work, and later that night when I got home the unit was dead, dead, dead. At first I though my 5.1 drivers were bad or something. I tried restarting my laptop, reinstalling the drivers, etc. I just couldn\'t fathom that the amp would overheat itself into failure mode when there wasn\'t even any music playing.Fast forward through me reading about 500-600 forum posts on this topic, and I now realize that the amplifier in these things is in the class of amp that draws large current even when no sound is coming out. Doh. When I took EE classes in college, we used linear regulators on small projects, but used switched regulators on anything medium sized or above. Having never done any work with analog electronics, though, it never occurred to me that they would use a linear regulator for a circuit this big. It makes sense to me now after reading about the noise issues of a switching regulator, but I was still truly caught off guard. I really think if I had continued to turn the unit off after every use then they would still be working today.Anyway, this is a long rambling post which mainly begs to ask two questions.1) Even if this amplifier is poorly designed and doesn\'t conduct heat efficiently enough, why isn\'t there a thermal shutoff before the system fries itself? That seems like the bigger WTF to me. Sure, Klipsch outsourced the amp design and construction, but they could have at least built in safeguards. I\'m surprised none of these things have caught on fire. The pictures I found online today of some of these blown amps look like they weren\'t far from burning the house down.2) Has anybody here sent their amp to that guy on ebay? If he can be trusted and is still in business, I would much rather spend $60 getting him to fix the root problem, rather than $90 for Klipsch to send me another faulty amplifier. From what I\'ve read, that is all that their amp ""service"" consists of...',)"

"('I bought the GCS1734 4-port USB KVMP to replace an older IOGEAR GCS84A 4-port PS-2 KVM so I could use it with a wireless mouse. It sort-of works, but it\'s a step backwards from the older KVM. The hot keys are more complicated, and it doesn\'t support some keyboards.The old PS-2 KVM used a quick double-tap on the left or right control keys to switch monitors. Simple, and easy to do with a guitar or scope probe in the other hand. It would have been great if IOGEAR had kept this hot-key combination in their new products, but they didn\'t.The new USB KVMP hot-key sequence is four key presses using three different keys, and requires both hands and looking at the keyboard. This direct-dial hot-key sequence (there\'s a step to next higher port, but no step to next lower port) is double-tap scroll-lock, press a number key (on the main keyboard, not the numeric keypad) and then press the return key. The scroll-lock can be remapped to the control key, which is easier to hit, and jumping to the next higher port only requires three key presses on two keys. There are also hot-key sequences for assigning the audio and USB peripherals independent of the console (keyboard/mouse/display) which use five presses on four different keys.I bought a Corsair Vengeance K60 mechanical gamer keyboard to use with this KVM, and discovered it doesn\'t work when plugged into the front console USB ports. The K60 only works when plugged into the rear peripheral USB ports, and according to a web post by another user who contacted Corsair support, this is because the K60 sends 16-bit data instead of the expected 8-bit data. This wouldn\'t be a problem if the hot keys still worked, but these ports aren\'t monitored for the hot-key sequences!This means the console can only be assigned using the switches on the front panel of the KVMP, and here\'s the rub: you must press-and-hold these for several seconds to switch the USB peripheral hub (and the attached keyboard) with the console!In addition to the above issues, I have noticed lags, gaps, and stuttering keys when switching the console and when inserting and removing other peripherals on the USB ports attached to the computers (several types of Win7, Mac OSX, WinXP, linux machines). This is even with simple PS-2 to USB and wired USB keyboard/mouse combinations.On the plus side, the video quality is good at 1920x1200 60Hz. I haven\'t tested at higher resolutions because my LCD monitor doesn\'t support them.At 6 feet long, the four included cables are a good length, and at just over 1/4"" thick, are reasonably flexible. They incorporate the audio, USB and video lines into one cable, and the computer end fans-out the audio and USB cables from the VGA connector using three 1/8"" thick, 21"" long cables. I found these unnecessarily long for my use, but if you have a huge laptop with the video and audio connectors on opposite sides of the case, this might be useful. The audio jacks include a removable plastic cover that\'s attached to the cable with a short loop. Apparently, these are to keep the audio from humming/buzzing if they\'re left unconnected and dangling around on the floor. A nice touch, but I would prefer something on the machine-side VGA connector to keep the ends of the two long screws from getting hung-up on other cables when pulling the cables through the inevitable bundle of Ethernet, USB, power, and other cables behind the desk/console station.This KVMP comes with a plastic ""shoe"" that friction-fits to one end so it can be mounted vertically, but I found the weight of the attached cables tends to pull it backward when you do so. Some double stick tape might remedy this if necessary.',)"

"('KEYSPAN USA-19HS USB to Serial adapter:Summary:I had a device that came with a USB-Serial adapter from FTDI Chip that only worked intermittently, was poorly documented, and the vendor ignored my e-mail.  The KEYSPAN USA-19HS worked flawlessly, is well documented, and comes with a powerful utility (which I did not need).Details:Recently I acquired a ""Duplimate Mark IV bis"" duplicate bridge card dealer.  It uses a serial connection to the host Windows computer.  I\'m using an IBM Thinkpad T40 running Windows XP SP2.The computer has no serial ports, but the Duplimate came with an adapter, as well as a serial cable.  That adapter has a captive USP cable, and a DB9-F connector for the serial device (unusually, with screws - no independent serial cable needed).  The adapter was identified only by manufacturer, FTDI Chip.  It came with a mini-CD, which I explored and used to print out the manual.  I eventually deduced that the adapter was an HL-340, which I found stamped on the DB9 connector and as the name of a folder on the mini-CD, but not in the manual.  I installed a driver in that folder, and got the dealer to work - kind of.  It would actually deal a hand only about half the time, otherwise taking several seconds to report a communications error.  By the time I had hit Ctrl-A to restart dealing for the fifth time on a deal, I was wondering what I would do if it refused to deal.  FTDI Chip has a web site, and I downloaded a driver from there - no use.  I did perform a successful reinstall without using the HL-340 folder directly, with no change in results.  A detailed e-mail to FTDI chip produced no response.  If you ever have a chance to buy something from FTDI Chip - DON\'T!Two days ago, I ordered the KEYSPAN USA-19HS from Amazon for just under $32, with free shipping.  It arrived today, and I put it through its paces.  It comes with a full-size CD.  First, I removed the old driver.  When I installed the Keyspan software, which must be done with the adapter disconnected, the driver went right in.  (I also took the time to register the product.)  A Keyspan USB Serial Adapter folder appeared on my Programs menu, and it contains a powerful and potentially useful Keyspan Serial Assistant - as well as the manual in HTML and PDF.  Don\'t read the manual on CD - it\'s slow - wait to read it on your computer.  The manual is excellent, tho you may not need it.The adapter has a short detachable USB cable, which is probably fine for most applications; but if you need a longer one, you can substitute.  Using the serial assistant or Start-Control Panel-System-Hardware-Ports confirmed that the newly connected serial port was COM3.  The DB9-M connector has nuts for the screws on a typical serial cable, so it would not mate with the Duplimate, which also has nuts.  No problem, I had the serial cable that came with the Duplimate.  While using the extra cable is not as convenient, I judge this to be the correct implementation, because it will mate with captive or specialized serial cables. Because my WinDup software was already configured for COM3, I was able to fire it up and start dealing immediately.  No more communications errors, no more waiting to hit Ctrl-A if the machine did not start dealing immediately.  It always started dealing as soon as I inserted the next board.',)"

"('I purchased this telescope from Orion\'s official website because they had a sale but either way, this telescope has been one of the best purchases I made online. One thing any new telescope owner should know is that you will NOT get the images you see on NASA or semi-professional astrophotographers. The awesome vivid colors in those pictures come from post processing and long exposures. Post processing means that the photo is processed with computer software to give colors to the UV and infrared rays which is not visible to human eyes. The photos are also enhanced with long exposures meaning the camera is left to capture light for more than an instant. This allows more details to be seen and dimmer lights to be seemingly brightened. So don\'t be surprised if you look up photos of the nebulae, star clusters, and etc. and they look ""bigger"" than what\'s in your telescope.Another similar point is when looking at the planets in our solar system. The best planets to observe are Jupiter and Saturn but they will not appear as big objects in your telescope. Looking at them through the lowest magnification, you will see them as colored dots. At the highest best magnification around 180x, the planets will appear as 1&lt; cm dots but you can see clear details like Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot and Saturn\'s divided rings. For Deep Sky Objects, the best ones I have observed are the Polaris cluster and the Orion nebula.So why should you still buy a telescope if you don\'t get the expected views you want? The reason is you get to participate in an amazingly beautiful treasure hunt. There is personal satisfaction to finding a object using a star chart or star observing iPhone app. You will be amazed at how your telescope can magnify a tiny barely visible dot in the sky to things like beautiful star cluster. Sometimes, the objects you see with your own telescope in real time appear more beautiful than those in photos because without post processing, the clear color of the objects shine much more vividly. Searching for planets, nebulae, and etc. is also something you can do with family, girlfriend/boyfriend, and etc. that you can not do with photos. Showing off your find and helping others use a telescope is very much a fun group activity.Tips:*Let your eyes adjust to the darkness before trying to find smaller objects*Buy a moon filter available on both Orion\'s website and Amazon if you are planning to do a lot of moon watching because the focused moon light can be quite bright, both masking subtle details of the moon surface and hurting your eyes after long exposures.*Best way to adjust your finder scope (the 6x scope attached to the top of your main telescope) is to point your telescope at Jupiter and adjusting the finder scope.*Hold the telescope at lower angles because the heavier top will tilt to the ground by itself*Planets, stars, and the Earth move so objects drift and move out of your view so if you leave the telescope focused on a object for 5 min, it might be gone when you come back.*!If you live in light polluted areas (i.e the city), you might not be able to see fainter objects and in areas with intense light pollution, planets might only be visible at certain times*There are websites you can search for online that give you light pollution ratings for your area and times*Use lower magnifications for clusters and nebulae and higher magnifications for planetsPROS*Probably best beginner telescope - The construction feels solid and yet portable enough to carry*Contains a free copy of a deep sky object finding software but might also want to look into iOS apps*No need to tune your telescope b/c of weather conditions*Setup is relatively easy*Can move up, down, and rotate*Orion cluster, Polaris Star Cluster, Hercules Star Cluster, Moon craters, Saturn, and Jupiter are good to observe with this telescope*Has a large amount of accessories NOT INCLUDED like colored lenses, Sun filters, and etc.CONS*Too big to walk long distance or put in backpack (i.e hiking)*Only 2 lenses included which does not achieve highest visible magnification*Light collecting ability is limited so distant and dim objects are not visible*Heavier top can fall to the ground at lower angles if telescope is not heldSummary: Good usage/cost ratio for a beginner telescope.

"('Good bang for the buck, but should have a *much* more powerful internal amp to make justice to the otherwise great project.Despite the weak internal amp, the V1020 can handle high power producing deep frequencies without distortion, and plays very well once you pump the gain up.The cabinet is very well made, has simple and functional plugs, the detachable power cord is indeed a plus, and the speaker itself is very well made (almost a shame it stays hidden, pointing to the floor). But, maybe because I compare it to my fantastic 37 year old B.I.C. Formula 4 speakers, that answer down to 25Hz without any fancy amplification (the V1020 starts at 26Hz), this sub requires at least a +6db adjust at my pre-amplifier to make it sound at the same level as my F4s powered by a 100w Kenwood VR-7070 (although the sub\'s 160 Watts Built-in Amplifier is 60% more powerful). Once I set the gain right, all is good, but still I can\'t really find it useful when set along my F4s. Probably shows more when set with the much smaller and limited speakers that B.I.C. makes nowadays. Anyway, for the price, yes, I do recommend it (my Formula 4s cost 3x more at Ebay). Just remember to crank up the gain if you already own a decent pair of front speakers - but, then again, you might not want a sub at all if you do.--------------------- June 2014 update -In one phrase: it NEVER, EVER DISTORTED (and I\'ve tried neighborhood war sound levels). Connected to the 100w THX certified Kenwood VR-7070 receiver\'s pre-amp sub out, I set the sub\'s controls at full volume and crossover at about 80Hz; on the receiver I still let the sub gain at +6db to match my front set, but I\'m pinning that on my 1973 BIC Formula Four extreme sensitivity: 95 dB @1w. The rest of the system is aBIC America FH6-LCR Dual 6.5-Inch 175-Watt LCR Speaker with Mid/High Frequency Hornas center (-4db adjustment at the receiver), a pair ofBic America FH-65B Bookshelf Speakers 350 Watt 6.5IN 2 Way (each)as surround. And it sounds all right to my ears.As with most systems, I prefer 2.1 when listening music, and 5.1 when watching video.I don\'t usually listen at high volumes, but during a party I noticed some vibrations. After some search, we found that it was the whole sub ""jumping"" over my hard stone floor (!) whenever the drummer kicked his foot. I\'ve putted some weights over it (large vase over several magazines), and it now stands still whatever volume I set it at.And it appears to be long lasting. The finishing still looks as new as the day it came out of the box (and we move it weekly for house cleaning). Since it downfires, I don\'t have to rotate the speaker as I have to do to my Formula Four\'s every quarter (I rotate the woofers 90, so that they don\'t warp. Being working for over 40 years, but it\'s a pain).Considering the price, I\'m upgrading my rate from three to four stars.

One of the least taxing subwoofer dialogues as far as most movies go, but anyhow I needed a replacement.  I was really torn which Sub to get, this is just a bedroom setup and I didn\'t need true rump stomping bass like I have in my living room, just something that sounded good and would handle anything I threw at it. I narrowed it down to the V1220, the F12, or the Pinnacle Sub 200 and was leaning towards the Pinnacle but couldn\'t find reviews on it, so I was a bit apprehensive.  I then decided on the F12, but it was out of stock and I needed bass NOW, so I finally settled on the V1220.The V1220 came the next day and I un-boxed it and hooked it up.  I found where it clipped then used half that volume and put a 50hz square wave through it but after about 10 minutes I could smell it was getting very hot and sure enough the back plate was scalding hot.  Ok, poor amp design, but it was cheap enough I guess. I backed off the power and gave it a ramping 50-100hz square wave for 10 hours to loosen the spider a bit.  Now it\'s time to play.  I tried some music, a few blu-ray movies mounted in the HTPC and put it through it\'s paces.  It was clear that there was a serious gap between my existing harman kardon speakers and this sub.  After playing some more, changing crossover points, volumes, everything I could think of it was evident they tuned this sub into the ground and meant it for purely LFE and not to take up the slack from small surround speakers.  The HKTS10 system is dual 3.5s with a 3/4"" dome for center then single 3.5 with 3/4"" dome for the rest, and a rather well tuned 12"" sub with 150wRms amp. The 3.5""s falloff pretty hard around 80-90hz and can\'t even replicate the bass from the good door knocking, but the Harman Kardon 12"" sub was tuned perfectly to fill this gap. I can\'t really fault the V1220 for being tuned so low, I guess.  I played with some hard foam to cut down the port volume(displacement not dB) just to change the tuning a bit, and if they had tuned this up 5-8hz it would have been great. But paired with the little Harman Kardon 3.5""s there isn\'t enough midbass.Likes:Made in the USPriceDecent Low extensionDecent woodGood sound when paired with center and front that can do decent midbassDislikes:Bad tuning(it could really use a few Hz higher tuning)cheap amp(no way it\'s 200wRms, it\'s not even 150w, and it can\'t handle half power at 100% duty cycle without overheating)only good for LFE, don\'t expect mid-bass from it.plastic feetit turns off if the volume is too low(easily disable but still annoying)**** Edit 6/22/10 *****I was going to return this but decided to keep it and upgrade the rest of my system in my bedroom. First I tried aBIC America FH6-LCR Dual 6.5-Inch 175-Watt LCR Speaker with Mid/High Frequency Hornfor a center but again the timbre didn\'t quite match with the V1220 and the FH6 was a bit bright for my taste. I returned the FH6 and picked up aBIC America DV-62CLRS 6-Inch 2-Way Center Channel Speakerand a pair ofBIC America DV62si Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and finally it sounds pretty decent for a bedroom setup.  The only real downside is that I went from small speakers to relatively large to get enough mid-bass to blend well. I relegated my original fronts to the rear and the center to a box in the garage.  Now with a 7.1 system with the V1220 taking up the slack from Bic 6.5""s it sounds MUCH better, and using the original HK fronts to upgrade my 5.1 to 7.1 added a bit more depth in the room.I\'m still borderline 3.5-4 stars.  I truly believe this would be far better if tuned up a few Hz(which the F12 is), but after replacing the center and front Harman Kardon 3.5"" speakers to ported BIC 6.5"" drivers the V1220 shines pretty good.(and I LOVE the DV-62CLRS).The only warning I\'d give about this is if you have a matched setup with small drivers and you are picky about sound, then you might notice a gap in the mid-bass with this sub. If your front and center are up to the task of handling mid-bass, then the V1220 blends in well.  I\'d probably get the F12 if I had it to do over again, but I\'m too lazy to box this behemoth up and drag it down to UPS.I run a pair of Definitive supercube IIs in my living room, and a pair of Image dynamics subs in my car and this doesn\'t come anywhere near the SQ of either of those, but cost much less.  This is a decent cheap sub, nothing more, nothing less. With proper midbass this thing is pretty happy in my bedroom.',)"
"(""2011 EDIT: This unit's SSL certificate has expired and is no longer accessible via the web interface! I have read up on it, and apparently the way to correct it is to make sure the unit does NOT find the correct time. Leave it in 2006. Netgear of course offers ZERO support for this problem. If you can't access your unit, you will have to reset it to the default settings by holding the reset button for 5 seconds. Then you can access the interface and make sure it doesn't have access to DNS or default gateway. Leave them blank. Of course your time will be off, but at least you'll be able to access the AP. There is a version of DD-WRT, but unfortunately they think only businesses uses this Access Point so they charge for it. I've lowered my rating of this unit because Netgear clearly doesn't expect their equipment to last 5 years even though they are still selling these as new, and because they didn't offer any firmware update to correct the problem.Not quite sure why the other reviewers had so many issues. I have no formal training in wireless networks and had no real problems with the access points themselves. Maybe because I didn't use WPA. I used two of these AP's to bridge two apartment buildings and several apartments connecting a total of somewhere around 16 PC's. The only issue I had was one of the power supplies was bad on arrival.These units have removable antennas so you can add larger antennas or even amplifiers.I used one of these AP's with the Netgear ANT24D18 which even though I got a good deal was a slightly expensive option. The other I used with a much cheaper (live and learn) rooftop antenna that looks more like a microwave antenna. I attached the Netgear antenna to the access point on a balcony of the apartment building across the street. Total distance between the antennas was probably only 300 feet.Once I aligned the signal of the two antennas, the signal quality was outstanding. Both AP's connected at turbo '108 mbps' speed. I was able to easily watch a streaming video from one computer in one building to a computer in the other. We also played LAN video games between buildings with no issues.Because of the remote outdoor locations of one of the AP's (in a waterproof box but still exposed to extreme temperatures and humidity) and a shortage of expensive antenna wire, I ran the power over two of the unused ethernet wires and still had zero issues and rarely lost packets. The only issue I had was during severe windstorms that would misalign the antennas which would lower signal quality and strength. Oh, also the connection between the two AP's was WEP encrypted 152 bit. I also had another AP (DLink) running at the same time and had no interference issues. The Dlink however has it's own set of issues, big surprise though. Quality-wise Netgear has always been above DLink and Linksys for me. A Linksys AP I use at work can barely transmit through one wall without dropping signal like crazy.The only other bad thing I can say is that in a very, very quiet room, sometimes you can hear a tiny buzz from the AP."",)"

"('This is for the ""Tamron SP AF 2x Pro Teleconverter for Nikon Mount Lenses"". However, I feel the review has pertinent information for canon-mount TCs too.I have attached a picture of the newly designed nikon-mount 2x TC in customer pictures above (again, I know this is page is a canon-mount product but the info applies to both types)First, I wanted to give everyone a heads-up. The pictured item for this product (as of today 5/13/11) is white with a black rubberized grip on it. However, recently Tamron changed the style of the teleconverter to be all black. I confirmed this with Tamron directly (you can too - 1-800-827-8880) and the rep said that as long as the teleconverter has a model number 300F on it that it\'s the correct ""pro"" 2x teleconverter as opposed to their lower-end 2x teleconverter.As to my experience with the product, the quality and build seems great. I\'ve always been impressed with Tamron as an alternative to pricier lens companies. I\'m using it primarily with a Tamron 18-270 PZD VC lens and the extra reach is incredible (at full tele with the D90 crop factor the lens\' 35mm equivalent focal length is 820mm!!). When attached to my Nikon D90 body, however, the Vibration Compensation (VC) is a little spotty. It will work MOST of the time and stabilization efficacy doesn\'t seem to be affected, but on occasion the VC will just no longer activate. A very quick and easy fix for it is to just semi-detach and then reattach the lens/telconverter (don\'t have to fully remove) and voila the VC works again -- if only for a little while. Strange issue, but not too much of a hassle.When I contacted Tamron about the VC issue the representative informed me that it is because this teleconverter is ""not compatible"" with any VC lenses (at least Tamron ones), which perhaps explains the sporadic functionality. However, I usually understand ""not compatible"" to mean ""doesn\'t work ever"" but my experience is that the VC on my 18-270 PZD VC works just fine -- just when it\'s in a good mood.Overall, I\'m very happy with this teleconverter. Don\'t expect AF to work unless you\'re using it with a very fast lens because it attenuates the amount of light (basically, if your lens is a f/2.8, adding this TC makes it an f/5.6). And to my knowledge the majority of AF systems don\'t function well or don\'t function at all at apertures smaller than f/5.6 (feel free to correct me in the comments). That said, AF did work under bright conditions, so again it\'s not that big a deal.In short, you get a lot of extra reach, but you have to give up AF and VC sometimes. But there\'s no free lunch in the world and unless you want to drop a few grand on a fast tele lens, this is a good alternative for ~$250. But realistically if you\'re expecting to hand-hold an 800mm lens then perhaps your expectations need some reconsideration ;)',)"
"('I got this for backing up my data.  It is very fast and easy setup.  It looks nice on your desk too.',)"
"(""This was great while it lasted. Then today I guess I pulled it out of the USB port a little too firmly, and suddenly it was all over.  The computer no longer recognized my JumpDrive.  Once I got past the numb shock and denial phase that typically follows the loss of a massive amount of data, I marched the JumpDrive back to Circuit City, where fortunately I was still within the bounds of their product return policy (by ONE day, WHEW!) and I decided to purchase a SanDisk Mini Cruzer (I'll give my opinion on that one after a substantial amount of time has lapsed -- got it at CompUSA and they offered me a one-year warranty for $12 guaranteeing a free replacement in case ANYTHING goes wrong, so I bought the protection). Three words to the wise: BACK IT UP. And don't yank it out of the port too hard. Handle it as you would a flower petal in danger of ripping apart when you remove it & maybe you'll have better luck.Here is my original review of the Lexar Jump Drive....Before discovering this marvelous device I was using clunky Zip disks to store my files.  Now I use only the Lexar JumpDrive to store and transfer large graphic files from school to my home PC.  When I plugged the device into my Dell Dimension desktop for the first time, it was recognized immediately (in the back USB port; the front USB port under the flap is awkwardly positioned and can't accomodate this drive).Though I got an immediate popup message telling me that I had plugged a hi-speed (2.0) device into a non-hi-speed USB port and that performance would be slowed down, before I had a chance to fret about how long the process would take, the files were already copied- so slowness turned out to be a non-issue.The real test was when I took it to school and transferred/viewed/saved data using the school's MACs.  So far I tried it on two separate MACs and the Lexar was immediately recognized.I highly recommend this for students. One little tip though - If you save files in programs like Quark, Photoshop or Illustrator and you originate the file on a MAC, & will need to transfer it to a PC, remember to give the document the right file extension so your PC can read it (MAC doesn't require a file extension be assigned).  (In case you were wondering, use .qxd for Quark, .psd for Photoshop, and .ai for illustrator).When I forgot to do this for a Quark file, I simply clicked on the saved file that was stored in the Lexar jump drive and saved it to my desktop without opening it.  The file was converted automatically and I was able to read it with no problems or issues.This device is a lifesaver and has spared me hours of time in the school's studio working on my homework.  What a joy it is to be able to get everything accomplished at home.  I'm not sure how I got along without it. The outer rubber cap makes me feel confident that this thing isn't going to get damaged when not in use.  Though it doesn't appear to be fragile, I would not recommend putting it on a keychain since there's little point in having it battered around for no good reason on a daily basis.On a final note, the 512MB version for $49 from Amazon is a great deal. Unfortunately a lot of people must have also thought so and I had to cancel my order since I couldn't get it delivered for a couple of extra weeks, and wound up buying it locally and paying a bit more.  But if you are debating whether or not the JumpDrive is worth it, the answer is a definite yes.If you were further wondering whether you should go with a Zip Drive instead, and have the need to transfer files from MACs to PCs and vice versa, then you'd also require third party software for your PC to read the MAC files from your Zip Disk, in additon to the cost of the drive (about $80 for a 100MB drive) and the disks themselves (about $10 a pop).  So save yourself the extra cost and clunkiness of the Zip & go with the JumpDrive. I doubt you'll have reason to regret it."",)"
"(""I have had this camera for about 6 months. I wanted a simple point & shoot to replace a old and dead Kodak DX3900. The kodak was great, except it lasted about a year (seems to be a common problem). I never got a blurred image, and very rarely was anything other than crystal clear. With the T1, it has been a battle. I have gone to other sites trying to find tweaks, etc.First the good:1. The LCD screen is really great. Large, clear, and seems to repel fingerprints (not one in 6 months of use).2. This fits in your pocket (but I do NOT recommend it, as scratching the screen will be VERY expensive).3. The buttons, although having a decent learning curve, become easy to use pretty quickly (except for deleting pictures you just took....because that button also controls the resolution, I sometimes switch back and forth accidently).4. Lens cover. Not only does it protect the lens, but it's kind of cool, and turns it on and off.5. Close-ups are just astounding (if you are steady). I can get less than an inch from something with absolute clarity (just make sure you have enough light).6. The video is better than on my Sony Camcorder (when recorded on the memory stick).Now the Bad & the Ugly:1. Flash is terrible indoors without tweaking2. Auto mode is useless unless you have plenty (and I mean PLENTY) of light3. Lag is so long that my 17 month is sometimes completely out of the frame when the picture is actually taken, or, there is such a blur that it looks like he's a world class sprinter.4. Telephoto is weak, and produces more noise than I would like.5. Battery life is terrible, and appears to drain even while off!6. This is not a point and shoot, at least not what I was looking for. You have to change the settings for every different situation.7. Impossible to take video indoors unless there is PLENTY of light.8. Red eye is terrible, even with reduction on, people look like demons.Now, for those who went ahead and bought this camera:For indoor shots, I have found the best way to get good light shots is by playing with the white balance. This also eliminates the yellow hue that is in most of the indoor pictures I had previously taken. I only switch to Auto mode if I am outside and it is sunny. Otherwise, you are stuck in program mode and have to set things up semi-manually. You don't need to pick your f-stops or anything, but it is a bit of a hassle making the needed adjustments for each particular shot. The night shots are very tricky. You can get some great effects, but it takes a lot of practice and experimenting.This is more a camera for a hobbyist than someone who wants to just snap pictures. And that is why I give it only 2 stars.  With all that said, I am still looking for an easy P&S; (my wife still hates the camera and finds no redeeming qualities)."",)"

"('Before buying this tt, I read all the other reviews about hum and skate issues and decided to chance it.  Honestly, most of my vinyl isn\'t exactly worth a fortune or irreplaceable, and I just needed -something- for the bedroom.  I wasn\'t buying this to be audiophile grade, just something I could listen to vinyl with and alternately connect to my Mac.I have now owned the AT-PL120 for exactly one day.  Granted, this hasn\'t given me much time to experiment.  First off, let me note that the mat that comes with this is crap and I\'m buying a new one today.  Just, throw it away or use it as a coaster.Secondly, I have not experienced the dreaded hum yet (even with the volume all the way up) nor did I have any skating issues, however I have not tried any carts other than the one included.  I know there are tons of reviews of hum, so I spent plenty of time trying to find it.  With the motor off, and the tone arm up, it\'s dead silence on my unit.  I think the people experiencing the hum just have random bad luck due to unskilled or just plain bad internal wiring (what do you expect for this cheap??) and ground looping issues in people\'s homes.However once you get the platter spinning you can definitely hear some motor noise before the record starts.  It\'s still audible during play though less noticeable.  It bugged me a little in parts, but for $200 I expected some noise...There is no auto-return but I knew that to begin with.  It\'s a pain but whatever, it is what it is -- it was $200, it has a steady spin, and it \'looks\' to be solidly built.  My only build complaint actually are the total crap built-in phono cables.  Really???? Built in?  What year is this? And they\'re only like 3 ft long.  Huge mistake.Now, as to the actual sound... So, to me it\'s not the best, at least with the included cart. This could also be caused by my VERY modern digital receiver.  I\'m not exactly old enough to have tons of old equipment lying around so I\'ll probably pick something up off eBay and see what sort of tone it produces.Really though, it\'s not bad at all, just not as full as I had hoped and I thought it lacked a bit of punch.  For example, Nico\'s voice on ""I\'ll Be Your Mirror"" was as haunting as always, and pretty lifelike but maybe not enough depth.  Overall, it\'s very adequate.If you are a bit younger, and are used to listening to MP3\'s off your iPod through crappy white headphones - you will be blown away.  You might have that experience listening to any vinyl, but this thing is a HUGE step up from my sister\'s plug\'n\'play $80 belt-drive Sony...  I mean, seriously, that thing sounds flat, not to mention noisy as hell.  This little player pumps out a relatively warm, dimensional, and rich sound, and it still gives you that satisfying and fun interactive music listening experience that you don\'t get with an MP3 player.I would highly recommend this player for anyone who wants to get into vinyl, and doesn\'t want to spend a fortune or who, like me, needs a second player.  I\'m happy I don\'t have to just listen to my iPod or CD\'s in my bedroom now, and I\'ll surely have fun playing with this in GarageBand soon.  It\'s a welcome addition, and worth pretty much exactly what I paid...',)"
"('Works OK',)"
"('I\'ve been using an S12 for about the last five years now, and it really is a superb headset.The headset is lightweight and comfortable to wear (I\'ve been on conference calls that have lasted over 24 hours (yes, really), and it was not a problem at any time. The light on the microphone when it\'s in use was helpful to let coworkers know when to approach quietly (so long as they approach from that side, of course).Connectivity wise, I\'ve used it on corporate digital phones as well as on my home phones; you should be able to connect to any phone that has a regular old handset attached, as it plugs into the handset socket. It\'s worth bearing in mind that with this kind of headset, the handset on the phone will have to be lifted off the cradle switch in order for you to speak (otherwise the phone stays in its \'hung up\' state). With the enterprise phones, it\'s pretty easy to leave the handset off the hook as there is a \'hang up\' or \'release\' button that will end a call for you, and you can pick up a ringing phone by pressing the line button for the line that\'s ringing. With most domestic phones, there\'s no such function (especially the release function), and I\'ve found that I have to use the handset to start/end the call. That\'s a minor inconvenience though compared to having to hold a handset for hours.The headset is plenty loud enough for my slightly deaf ears, and I\'ve managed to get it working nicely on all the phones I\'ve used it on so far. There are multiple phone settings - call a friend and get them to tell you which sounds best. Some will not work at all, others will sound distorted, and so forth so just experiment to find the right one.The \'headset\' button turns the headset function on and off. Frankly I almost never used it - I usually use the headset - but it is useful if you need to use the handset for some reason; just hit the button and sound goes through the handset instead (which is plugged into the back of the Plantronics unit of course). If you haven\'t used one of these before, note that there\'s a pretty short cable between the Plantronics unit and the phone handset socket, so they\'re going to be close - and since the handset is plugged into the back of the Plantronics but (for home phones at least) are likely to need to be in the cradle, they\'re going to have to be pretty close anyway.The mute button is where I have a tiny irritation. I\'ve been pretty sure that it has worked well for years, but recently I muted in order to cough, and was informed that albeit quietly, the other party on could hear something. We did some more testing on mute, including me saying very loudly ""can you hear me now"" and the other person was able to hear me well enough to respond. I don\'t know if that\'s because my S12 is five years old now, or if it was always like that and I got lucky. Either way it makes me nervous, and I would absolutely recommend doing your own testing if you rely on the button to cough, sneeze, curse, etc. One of my friends recommends saying ""You\'re all idiots!"" to confirm that you are truly on mute; follow his advice at your own risk. ;-)In five years, I\'ve only ever had two issues with the headset that required fixing. The first was a blown power supply (one of those annoying power brick things) - but that was caused by a major power surge in the building, and lots of other electronics were fried as well, so really not Plantronics\' fault. A replacement was about $30 as I recall, so no big deal. The other issue was more common - the buttons (mute in particular since it gets used a lot) can, with the right click, misalign the spring underneath it, and suddenly the button isn\'t clicking up and down correctly. For me, after a lot of percussive maintenance and some blind luck I was able to restore the previous springy function of the button, and have been a little more gentle with it since then. Seriously, for the price this sells for now, you really can\'t complain with a five year (and counting) life span.Bottom line - I could not have done half of what I did with a phone wedged between my ear and my shoulder. This is a superbly priced item that has great audio quality and pretty good durability so far. The only reason I\'d not buy this one would be if you could afford the Plantronics wireless; cos they are SUPER cool and make you look way fly and important in the office, PLUS you can use the bathroom without ""stepping away"" from your phone call. For the rest of us non-fly, unimportant people who don\'t want to be on the phone in a place that shouldn\'t ever have microphones in it, this is surely a winner.j.',)"

"('After a great deal of research I decided to upgrade from the Nikon 18-70 f/3.5-4.5 kit lens to the Nikon 16-85 f/3.5-5.6.  I was looking for sharper glass that would give my images greater \'pop\' (as well as a portrait zoom) and finally purchased one from an Amazon affiliate (Adorama).(Yes, this is a Nikon 17-55 f/2.8 review.  Please read on.)I tested the 16-85 for a week and found the glass to be both sharp and contrasty.  The images I made with it show good detail.  On the other hand, it \'feels\' cheaply made.  The zoom is sticky and tends to get caught, often preventing one from selecting the exact framing they were looking for.  In practical use the lens is f/5 at 50mm and f/5.6 shortly thereafter.  It is not a good choice as a portrait lens, especially if you like blurred backgrounds.Funny thing, with the new 16-85 in my hands I found myself looking to buy a \'portrait\' lens such as a 50 1.8 or 85 1.8.  After looking for a day or so, I thought to myself, ""this is silly.""  Conclusion?-  this is a very good kit lens and the 18-70 might be just as good. (Actually, at f/4.5 on the long end the 18-70 is an adequate portrait lens.)  Also, if I had to buy a new portrait lens to go with it, then the cost difference between the 16-85 and the 17-55 was out the door.  Taking advantage of a VERY generous return policy I sent the 16-85 back and ordered the Nikon 17-55 f/2.8.The 17-55 f/2.8 balances well on my D90\'s; even the one without an external battery pack. The combination feels right in my hands.  Weight wise, I find it to be lighter than my other, daily use, lenses (Nikon 80-200 f/2.8, Nikon 300 f/4).  Construction wise this lens is very well made with good zooming action.  Other reviewers note that the zooming action of the 17-55 is \'sticky.\'  In comparison with the really sticky 16-85 I would say, instead, that it is well damped.  In practical use I find that I do not miss the wide, or tele ends, of the 16-85.  Of note, you will need an external flash with the 17-55.  The on-camera flash sits too low and will produce vignetting at wide angles.  This lens excels at available light shooting.  Particularly, in those instances where flash is not wanted, or permitted.  (My photography generally involves nature at dawn/dusk and stage performances.)  In available light this lens produces very \'sharp!\' images, indeed.As stated, buying any lens is all about the image.  The 17-55 f/2.8 produces sharp, contrasty, images.  Also, backgrounds are nicely blurred when the lens is shot wide open.  I find this to be an excellent portrait, and daily use, lens.By the way, when I was researching this lens I came across a review on B&H; Photo\'s website by the photographer for Lamborghini.  He pointed out that all of the images on his website, of Lamborghini\'s, were taken with the 17-55 f/2.8.  Check them out and see what this lens can do in the right hands: google shirakiphoto.Final analysis:  the Nikon 18-70 f/3.5-4.5 is an excellent kit lens that appears to be the equal of the Nikon 16-85.  If you are looking to step up from a kit lens to one that can be used for portraits, and available light shooting, then the Nikon 17-55 is your lens in the DX format.',)"

(otherwise, you\'ll end up getting it anyway as your gear selection grows.) in retrospect, i would recommend this more as storage for just your camera (w/cables, memory cards, filters, speedlight) or if you have a small (2-3 lens) outfit. get the vgc-13 if you have a lot of lenses (more than 5) and/or a long telephoto lens.i ordered the vanguard hard case because i didn\'t want to just toss my extra lenses in a backpack. also, i live in california, so you never know when an earthquake might hit.when it arrived today--beating the shipping estimate by over a week--i was fairly impressed out of the box. it\'s brushed aluminum hardware and sides, backed with slightly ribbed ABS plastic on the outside. on the inside, there\'s a waffle-foam top, a two-layer foam bottom, several rubber section dividers, and a dice-pattern foam sheet. the dividers slide together into any number of configurations, the foam can be used to custom-fit pieces. you also get two keys for the front locks and a shoulder strap that clips onto the side.it\'s a rugged-seeming package that doesn\'t look cheap, but is a bit on the small side--amazon offers no specs, but this is the VGP-13S model, the dimensions are 15.75"" x 9.9"" x 6.9""--although compact might be a more politically-correct term.after loading it up with some gear, here\'s what i was able to fit into it:-70-300 tele w/ hood-12-24 wide angle w/ hood-15 fisheye w/ hood-50 prime-flash-two 3-filter kits and 3 loose filters-two extra batteries.obviously, this is not a solution to hold all your gear if you have much more than 2 lenses and one body. then again, the relatively small size does offer a degree of portability, even if its just from one end of your studio to another. the handle\'s nice and sturdy, but the nonpadded strap would probably get uncomfortable after more than about 5 minutes, although the case isn\'t all that heavy loaded up, unless you fill it with bricks or something.I decided to give the Vanguard 5 stars because this unit did what i wanted it to do, which was secure my gear in the event of any unforseen accidents, like accidentally siting on a lens or filter i\'ve left on the couch. even without cutting out the foam and fitting them into the partitioned dividers, it held the gear steady in the upright position--no jostling or rustling. i may leave the foam sheet untouched, so i can reconfigure it easier, but if you want to have a dedicated home for specific items you don\'t always need in your camera bag, this isn\'t a bad choice. i couldn\'t fit some of my lens pouches, cables, and the like, but those things aren\'t as in dire need of being properly secured as all your precious glass and/or body(s), so no biggie.overall, this is a versatile case that\'s just big enough to be a stay-at-home unit, and just small enough to venture out w/ you on a shoot. does exactly what you\'d expect, has a professional appearance, and is a good looker to boot. if you\'re an extreme gearhound, at the price it might be worth it to get two, although you might also want to look into the wheeled model, which is a bit bigger, for around twice the price, especially if you plan on carrying this around a lot.bottom line: why expose expensive glass and/or your camera to danger or possible damage? protect your investment -- after all, it\'s cheaper than sending a bag full of lenses in for warranty service if your drunk uncle roy has a mishap while watching WWF or NASCAR.',)"

"(""I bought this charger along with a PowerEx MH-C9000 charger expecting to play with them both and pick a winner.  Although the Ansmann Energy 8 is about as far from the PowerEx as two devices can be, I have to admit that I do like them both.I'm not going to say this is the best charger ever, because it is good for some types of people and usage, but not all.  If you like simplicity then this is the charger for you.  Each batter position has a red/green LED and that is the full status you get.  Overall, it can display charging, refreshing, done, and bad battery.  That's it.There is no doubt that this charger generally does a good job under most conditions, but I take away one star because the info it gives you is so limited and because it offers absolutely no control. Its this 5% of problem conditions that gives me some doubts that this charger is not perfect.  Here are two examples.First a put a PowerGenix NiZn battery in this charger.  These are pretty common and similar to NiMH but with a higher 1.6v voltage.  I put them in my PowerEx charger and they register an error in a few seconds.  The Ansmann acts like its charging it, but goes through a continuous charge and refreshing cycle which repeats over and over.  True the charger never claims to charge these, but its easy to tell these aren't NiMH batteries by their higher voltage, so I feel they should be rejected as bad.The second questionable problem was what I observed with several NiMH batteries.  This charger displays a red, yellow, or green indication of battery charge for 5 second when a battery is inserted.  This indicates under 25% charge, 25-80%, and 100% respectively. This is a nice feature, but on many occasions I have inserted a battery, gotten a yellow light indicating 25-80%, then, within 30 seconds to a minute the ready light turns on.  How can that be?  A partially charged battery can not fully charge in a minute. Impossible.  I've also seen many cases where I've had a charging and fully charged battery next to each other, I remove the charged battery and the charging battery suddenly indicates its charged.  I've seen it occur too many times to beleive its just a coincidence.In any case these problems are minor, and in most cases, the charger seems to work great.  Of course those cheapie chargers you get with a pack of batteries seem to work well as well, but I do expect more from a charger which costs much more.  Still if you don't mind spending the bucks, and you want simple, this charger is great and fairly quick.  The PowerEx charger is fantastic as well, and if you are willing to spend the time with it you will get even better results, but you just can't pop in the batteries and walk away, and some PowerEx modes can take up to 48 hours to complete, and to be honest, for slightly better results the time may not be worth it.Oh, one more thing. This is certainly NOT a travel charger. Its rather large, but it uses a cord and not a wall wart, which is nice.  And the users guide could be better. But overall I'm very happy with this charger, and the fact that my wife can use it with no training, is a big plus."",)"

"('Glance through my reviews and you\'ll see I\'m hardly inclined to give a product five stars without a good reason.  In this case I have no choice: the large Giottos Rocket Blaster is an item of such flawless quality and functionality that I literally can\'t think of a single way it could be improved.In its standing position it has approximately the proportions of a large drinking glass.  It\'s not small; in fact it\'s about as big as it can be while still fitting comfortably in your hand.  That\'s an important detail: squeezing it is easy enough but because of its size it moves enough air to direct a strong, smooth blast at whatever you\'re attempting to clean.  I\'ve spent half my life trying to blow dust off lenses with junky little blower/brushes that don\'t do a thing, and through size alone the large Giottos blaster is a vastly better tool for the job.Beyond that, there are lots of design details that help the Rocket Blaster do its job.  The materials, particularly the expensive silicone rubber used for the blower bulb itself, are of obvious high quality.  The bulb has a separate intake valve at its rear, so that it can fill more quickly than would be the case if the small blower nozzle were its only source of intake air.  And of course its freestanding ""rocket"" design is itself simple, useful and unique.  Look closely at the blower nozzle: the hole through which the air is forced is not round, it\'s an obviously-deliberate triangular shape, and if you think about it a moment it might occur to you that a this interesting shape might very well be more efficient at generating a coherent stream of air than a simple round nozzle.  Just another detail.The end result is an item that is deceptively simple but so nicely made that it just doesn\'t have any competition.  It\'s a flawless little piece of Italian design that anybody can buy, appreciate, and put to good use.  It might cost five times as much as a junky little blower/brush, but it must be at least a hundred times better.Miscellaneous notes:- This is the ""large"" Rocket Blaster.  There is also a small model, and in some cases here on Amazon it has not been perfectly clear what you\'re getting from the item photograph or description.  Here\'s how you tell difference: the small blaster has a round (spherical) bulb, the large one has an elongated, more or less elliptical bulb.- The large blaster is not ideal for carrying in a bag: it\'s a bit too big.  Buy one of the small models for keeping in your bag, and the large one for home.  The large one is probably two or three times as effective as the small one, however, so if you only intend to buy one, buy the large one.  Honestly, by the time you have a modest sum invested in camera gear, you really ought to have both.- It\'s hard to quantify the strength of the airflow - too subjective.  Here\'s my attempt anyway:  Putting a penny down on a smooth surface, the airflow from the large blaster from a distance of about three inches will make it jump.  At about the same distance, aiming the blaster at the palm of my hand will create a depression in the skin of the palm.  I can make a piece of ordinary copy paper flutter by using the blaster from about 2-1/2 feet away.  Compared to the small blaster, for those who have it, the large blaster seems to provide about double the force of air for about double the amount of time.',)"

"('I have an arsenal of weapons that I use for sensor cleaning.  They include fluids, swabs, Sensorklear pens, brushes, and Sensorklear loupes.  My first resort when a problem arises is my Giotto\'s blower.  Because it requires no solid contact with the sensor, it is the least likely to do harm.  The device blows hard enough to dislodge just about anything that isn\'t actually stuck to the surface or smeared onto the surface.  It uses one-way valves (check-valves) so that it sucks air in the back end and blows it out the tube in front.  The check valve on the rear probably serves to help filter the air.  BTW, the use of canned compressed air or even dry nitrogen is not a good idea because its cold temperature can cause condensation, and if the can is held wrong it can actually spew liquid.I\'ve read the reviews that say the blower just stirs up existing dust.  The reviewers who claim that are actually in some good company.  The professional camera book writer that I admire most makes the same point in some of his books, although I note that he may have come around lately.  I have a simple approach to minimizing the stirring-up-dust problem.  I turn the camera face down before I remove the lens or body cap.  I hold it up high, still facing down so that I can see the sensor.  Then I use the blower, being careful not to get the tip too close to the sensor.  Next I replace the cover on the front of the camera.  In this way, I let gravity help get any ""blown-around"" dust out.  Honestly, though, if I had so much dust inside there that it would swirl around when I used a blower, I\'d have to think I\'d been pretty sloppy with camera care.Here is the sequence I follow with sensor cleaning:On cameras that have a sensor shaking capability, I leave the cap or lens on, turn the camera face down, and switch the cleaning mode on and off a few times.  This shakes the sensor and sometimes removes the dust speck.  Next, I try the blower.  After that, I\'ll resort to a Butterfly brush.  Next is the SensorKlear pen.  Finally I\'ll use Eclipse fluid on a rectangular swab, typically with a piece of PecPad wrapped over the end.  If I can\'t see the problem speck easily with the naked eye, I\'ll use a SensorKlear loupe to see how I\'m doing.  If it\'s not visible with the loupe, it\'s not going to show up on an image.  Each of these approaches has compromises.  The blower\'s compromises are that it can potentially stir up problems; it won\'t remove anything that is stuck  or smeared on; and you have to be careful not to touch the sensor with the blower tip.  The Butterfly brush can do damage if pressed down too hard so that the casing around the base of the bristles touches the sensor.  If you let any brush touch anything other than the sensor, you will likely smear something onto the sensor. Even touching the inside of the camera can do this (trust me, I don\'t make this up).  The SensorKlear Pen wipes the surface.  Is it just rubbing the problem into the surface?  Cleaning fluids can leave residue; they aren\'t perfect either, but they sure make a sensor look clean.  Once, when I was forced to use cleaning fluid on a greasy smear on a sensor, I found that for weeks afterwards, the sensor seemed to attract dust.  The problem was not Eclispe, it was the smeared-on compound.  The problem went away after a month or so, perhaps because the residue finally outgassed away.Considering the alternatives I just covered, you can see why I tend to start with the Giotto\'s blower.  It is quick and simple, and it is low-risk if you just be careful and methodical.  It does double duty for lens filter cleaning, and it blows hard enough to be good for getting dust out of crevices in the camera body.If you don\'t have anything for camera cleaning, I recommend the blower as your first purchase.  If you want to keep going, I\'d go next to purchasing a loupe designed for sensor cleaning.  The built-in lights on the loops are fantastic when it comes to making surface smears or debris show up.Good luck!Tim',)"
"(""I was almost set on buying the Garmin 276C, but I felt may have been a little big for my vehice, and I didn't need to have a voice speaking to me, a beep is find with a message on a displau, so I opted for the Garmin 60C.  Im so please and saved $300.  The 56MB of map is enough to get by with, Im able to easily able to put in a large metropolitan area like Chicago and surrounding suburbs, and wrap up to Milwaukee, out to Madison, and around the lake with the latest City Select Auto Routing software.  The nice thing about this unit is it takes the older Garmin cables so if your coming from a Garmin V or II or II+, your cables will work.  The screen is wonderful, easy to read even with the backlight off, 30 hours of battery life, I have not tested this but I can tell it last a while with backlight off,  reception is very good, no problems in the car has option for external mounting, I have seen already accuracy estimated at 6 feet with WAAS, 7 to 12 feet while being used in car on dashboard.  Manysystem screens to navigate through may be confusing at first, but you can find what screens you like and change the order or set up.  The City Select software has very accurate maps, but I find the POI (point of interest) is out of date and the addressing of streets are set in a way to estimate the POI location, and sometimes it puts a place at the wrong end of a street, not bad if your using it in an unfamilar place, but if you pay to much attension to stuff in your home town you may be disappointed in finding places that no longer exist.  The auto routing works well, you can set audible beeps, my only complaint would be to adjust the volume. if you have a radio going in the car you may not hear the audible beep, Ive chosen the tones that seem to be tuned for my hearing, the visual glance will let you know when to be expecting that beep, its great. the ways it has instructed me to get to destination have been more then satisfactory. This GPS is great for geocaching, fast USB data transfers. So if you needed to change your maps for a trip, probably takes 2 minutes or 3 to swap out your maps. No biggie with the fast USB.  The automotive bracket you can get as an accessory, I think was not well designed, but you just have to make sure you snap the bottom of the unit into it and I was then satisfied (user error).  Having played with Garmins $800-$1200 automotive auto-routing, this does basically what does do in a smaller package and offers you great battery life and can use normal GPS off road features that you lack in some of the automotive GPS's,  And this is a great buy, if you know your gonna use only in a car and not take it on outdoor adventures."",)"

"(""Before you purchase binoculars, it is a good idea to think about how you will use them so you can choose a pair that meet your needs.After a lot of comparison shopping I chose the Nikon Action 8x40mm Binoculars as a gift for a friend because they have what he wanted from a general use binocular:1. Sharp, bright optics with porro prism.2. 5mm exit pupil (to match 50+ year old eyes).3. Good mechanical quality.4. Light weight.5. Close focus.These are NOT rugged, waterproof sporting binoculars. If that's what you need (for boating or hunting?) maybe you should keep looking. Otherwise, don't drop them in a lake!What I want most from binoculars are quality optics. I was pleasantly surprised by both the optical and mechanical quality at this price point.A lot of folks don't know what binoculars numbers refer to. The first number refers to the magnification. The second number refers to the size of the objective lens - the big lens. 8x40 binoculars magnify 8x, and have 40mm objective lenses.Exit pupil is something to consider. This is calculated by dividing the second number by the first. For 8x40 binoculars:  40/8 = 5mm  about the same as the entrance pupil of your eye if you are age 50 plus.If you are young and you don't mind carrying around some extra glass, you may consider binoculars with a large 7mm exit pupil that matches the large entrance pupil of your young eyes. This has no advantage during the day, but it can be helpful at twilight, for astronomy. You might consider:7x508x5610x70But be forwarned - the bigger the binocular, the more weight you carry around. You may prefer smaller, lighter binoculars for hiking or travel. Also keep in mind that at 10x you may need a tripod to hold your binoculars steady for the best views. Hand held, 10x binoculars shake so much that you may see just as much with 7x or 8x binoculars. For me, hand held, 8x is ideal.If you are age 50 years plus, the pupil of your eye will probably not open more than about 5mm, so you get no benefit from a big, heavy pair of binoculars with a 7mm exit pupil. Consider lighter binoculars with a 5mm exit pupil, that matches your eyes such as:7x358x4010x50Roof prism binoculars can be made small, but they are difficult and expensive to make properly. They also can not deliver as much light to your eye as a classic poro prism binocular of the same size and magnification. So if you want a bright, high quality image for a modest price, poro prism binoculars, like the Nikon Action 8x40 CF Binocular, may be your best choice. The only disadvantage of poro prism binoculars is they are larger than roof prism binoculars of the same size.Close focus allows you to have look at wildlife at very close range. Not only can these Nikons focus close (around 8 feet or 3 meters), but the focus is smooth and precise, unlike many modestly priced binoculars I have tried. In fact, I found them the best constructed binoculars I found in this price range.These binoculars are surprisingly light weight, which can be quite a benefit when you are hiking a long trail.All in all, I found these Nikons delivered exactly what I wanted for a surprisingly modest price."",)"
"('With a wide angle 9.3 deg of view the Nikon 7x35 Action binos give a spectacular view that is bright and have very good optics for their price. Thats why I bought them - they were cheap. I had no idea they\'d be this good! They are very easy to use. The center focus is smooth and can be turned with one finger. The diopter adjustment is on the right eyepiece where you\'d expect it - and is easy to turn but not so easy as to get readjusted by a slight bump. Diopter scale is kind of hard to read - maybe Nikon could have put some color on the + - marks? While I wish Nikon had included the same twist up/down eye-cups they included on the 8x42 & 8x25 Trailblazer ATB I do understand these are budget binocs. Instead Nikon put on rubber cups that just fold down for eyeglass wearers like me - or pop up for those lucky enough to have 20:20 vision - but they aren\'t otherwise adjustable. While the 7x35s aren\'t quite as good as the 8x42s or 8x25s for sharpness they do come close and more than a few friends and family that have compared them see no reason to buy the 8x42s for well over twice the price. And they are all impressed with the bright wide angle views.But this isn\'t a review of the 8x42 or 8x25 Nikon - its a review of the 7x35 action model. I\'m presuming the Action Extreme use the same optics since when I compared them all specs were the same - just no waterproofing on the regular Action models. Since I bought these to leave in my golf cart and I live in a dry climate waterproofing wasn\'t necessary. When it rains around here its an event and we put up the clubs and go home.I do have a few things I\'m critical of with these binocs besides the eye-cups. The caps don\'t fit well - they fall off in the case! So I just store them in the retail box and put the binocs in the carry case without the caps. Seems to keep them clean. Another rub is the rather shallow eye relief of ~1/2"".I just sold a Canon 10x30 IS binocs for more than I have into all of these - the Canon has image stabilization but the optics were no better than the 7x35 Action. I did a comparison and it was a draw - more power with the Canon - brighter view with the Nikon - sharpness was a draw - field of view with the Canon is 6 deg - like a tunnel compared to the 9.3 deg for the 7x35 Action. Canon put the money into the stabilization on the 10x30s. Both the 8x25 and 8x42 ATBs easily outdid the Canon for clarity and brightness. I was surprised the 8x25s were brighter than the Canon. Maybe that has something to do with the narrow field of view?If you are looking for inexpensive but decent binocular and don\'t need waterproofed models - and don\'t mind a bit of weight these just might work for you. If you need waterproofed take a look at the Action Extreme. If you are looking for both light weight and waterproofing the 8x25 Trailblazers are a better choice than the 7x35 Extremes IMO - less weight and marginally better optics.The views from these 7x35s are almost as sharp as the 8x25s and have that gorgeous 9.3 deg of view vs 8 deg for the 8x25s - and are brighter.I own 5 binoculars - the 7x35, 8x42, 8x25 all Nikon, 7x50 Pro Optic (Adorama ~1995 $125.00 and very sharp optics!), and a 16x80 Celestron that I use under the night sky on a tripod - and is also where I use the Pro Optics - under the night sky hand-held.I think I have enough binocs!',)"

(I found that it DOES have the key, but I don't have the KVM setup right now, nor have time to play with it to test it (FN+Pause/break, for those who are curious...), more on this below in Add. Thoughts)Other thoughts:I had the old IOGear mouse/keyboard version of this and have used it for years, and it is greatI only bought this USB version for when my laptop keyboard died, and I was waiting for a cheap replacement to get sent from China (worked out well for me) A KVM like this is really nice to have just 'laying around' for when you need to work on a second computer, which is why I bought it.Even having to use the 2nd keyboard just sitting on the far side of my desk to toggle PC i was controlling, it was a god-send for when I needed a KVM like this, to allow me to use my keyboard on my laptop and my desktop at the same time. (the delay of switching to windows was ~10 seconds for me, but Linux recognized it instantly it and used it smoothly.) I was under a lot of time/pressure constraints when I need this, so I didn't have time to 'fix' things that weren't 100% perfect, but I bet my issues were because of the VERY convoluted setup I needed (wireless keyboard/mouse, USB mass storage, USB HUB with both of those plugged into it, and then audio no used at all from KVM,) (The semester ending, and deadlines for projects made this the very best solution I could hope for when I needed it.)I used this for input toggle only, not output (laptop had working monitor) And VGA really isn't that useful on a modern PC/monitor, BUT, its a great legacy input, so I plan on setting this up as an alternate input for my PC when I need to help someone with their PC.Without even looking I know there are DVI KVMs, and probably HDMI/USB3/DisplayPort ones coming or out already, and those might better fit your need. And those solutions might fit your need better. But this device fit perfectly for what I needed, and might fit your needs.If you ONLY need USB toggle, and NEVER need audio or video, then a USB push toggle device can be had for ~10$ and is nice to have also. (Using both together to allow you to toggle USB mass storage separately from the keyboard/mouse (and if you want audio/video) is what I ended up using and it saved me hours and hours of plugging in and unplugging cables into/out of laptop/PC, and that alone was worth 2x the price I paid for this the USB switch combined)&#60;/Rambling response to try and help explain all the possible Point of Views that this needs to be approached from.&#62;"",)"
"('The device is GREAT.  The concept is GREAT.  The software is HORRIBLE!  The documentation is even WORSE!!!I hate it when a manufacturer goes through all the trouble to create a magnificent product, but then skimps on the software/drivers/documentation/etc.  This is a perfect example.  The device is rock-solid -- could not ask for a sturdier product without going to industrial quality (and price).  The software looks like it was written to entertain children!  The developers focused SO MUCH on creating pretty icons (that are actually ugly), that they completely forgot about usability -- and worse, they forgot to document!!!  There are no pop-up tips over any icons, nor is there any sort of Help feature anywhere.  There is a PDF owners manual, but it seems like it was written by a 10-year-old.  Half of the features are not even mentioned in the document.  It\'s extremely frustrating to know that the functionality is there, but I will have to poke around at the stupid software for days before I discover it!  Basically, a developer spent days coding each feature, but could not spend 2 minutes to put a label and description on it.  Features that nobody knows about or how to use are USELESS!If this device had even half-way decent software and documentation, it would get 5 stars -- but the software and documentation is so poor that it gets only 3 stars (maybe even just 2).As for the hardware, here\'s my review..SPEED: This device uses 802.11b, so it is limited to 11 Mbps, which can be too slow for video with moderate/high frame rates.  However, for security purposes, 5 frames per second is sufficient (slightly choppy video, but better than most VCR-based security systems).  I haven\'t tried recording at higher frame rates.  I imagine that if compression is set to high, fairly high frame rates can be achieved.IMAGE: This device can record up to 640x480 pixel video.  However, the software only supports 320x240.  In daylight, video seems relatively crisp, even at high compression.  At night, the camera doesn\'t fare as well.  D-Link makes other cameras that have much better night vision than this one.  If you\'re looking for a night-time camera, consider a different model.  The camera has a rotary focus dial on the lens, which can be set from close-up (20cm) through infinity.CHASIS: The camera housing is sturdy and the base is actually made of cast metal (I expected cheap plastic, but was pleasantly surprised).  The most-delicate part of the unit is the screw-on antenna.  It\'s not poorly made, but just not as rugged as the rest of the camera.  The camera is NOT intended for outdoor use.  I have it temporarily mounted on a window sill, pointed towards the front of my house.  Eventually, I will actually attach it to the window frame.  The base can be screwed into either the top or bottom of the camera, so it can be mounted on a ceiling, wall, bookshelf, or wherever you\'d like -- nicely done.Initial setup (getting it onto the network and seeing video) is somewhat straight forward, but the poor software and documentation become apparent right away.  Advanced setup (video surveillance, motion detection, recording, etc.) is EXTREMELY frustrating.  I\'m searching for 3rd party video surveillance software to use with it because I hate the packaged software so much.The webcam comes with its own built-in webserver, so it can host its own website (nice feature).  The built-in browser-based setup screen (kind of like configuring a LinkSys or D-Link router) does have a Help menu!  However, the only thing it has is the following text: ""For Help on Web Configuration settings, please refer to the Manual included with your Internet Camera.""  =-PGood luck!!!',)"

Since my office is smaller than my living room, and shares a wall with someone, I don't need as much power.  These were perfect.  The high end is crisp, and the subwoofer clean.  The volume control on the satellites is handy, but the bass adjustment is on the subwoofer.  I thought this would be an issue, but you actually kind of set it and monkey with it a bit in the beginning, and then leave it alone.  The satellites are much smaller than the Logitech and less cheesy looking, which makes them nicer on your desk.  I have to say again how killer the sound is.  Imaging is great, and it's crazy how they manage to do it with those tiny satellites.Desk at Home -  M-Audio StudioPro 3 Desktop Audio MonitorsThese simply have the best sound and imaging of everything I tried except the higher end M-Audio reference speakers.  No MP3 is going to sound ever as good as a CD through a component stereo(or an LP, but don't get me started).  But I am amazed at the quality of these speakers.  They wouldn;t have the power to fill a living room, or even an office.  By the time you're 6'-8' away from them, the imaging settles out a bit.  But for your desk or as satellite speakers for a TV that didn't come with great ones already, they are perfect.  They are a little bigger than many desktop speakers overall, but since many desktop speakers are oddly shaped with leaning towers and wide stands, they actually don;t take up as much more footprint comparatively.  The volume and headphone jack and aux in are all on one of the speakers, very handy for access and for plugging in your iPod at your desk.  I tried several of the higher end M-Audio speakers, and while I found them to be even better with more power and clarity, it just wasn't enough better to justify the additional size and expense.Living Room - Logitech Z-2300 THX-Certified 200-Watt 2.1 Speaker SystemThis system had the best overall power of everything I tried.  Everything else sounds good when you're close enough to the speakers, but as you move away it gets pretty weak.  For the living room you definitely need a 2.1 system.  Even the  M-Audio StudioPro 3 Desktop Audio Monitors, which seem the be the best of the 2 speaker systems couldn't handle a real room.  As mentioned in a number of other reviews, the subwoofer unit is larger than others out there.  I expect that's part of the reason these have good power.  Make sure you've got a good place to hide it.  Sound is very good comparatively.  Nothing is going to sound like a real 200w component stereo, but this comes pretty close.  I find that the imaging, or perceptual soundstage is a little lacking, not as clearly defined as with the JBL Creature II 3-Piece Powered Speaker System or the M-Audio Studio 3.  This got better when I added 6' RCA cable extenders to the satellite speaker wires which allowed me to separate the satellites a bit.  But still not great.  The volume knob thing is nice, and it's nice to have both volume and bass adjustment handy.  I guess you could have easily put the controls on one of the satellites like everyone else though.  The headphone jack on the volume control seems pointless to me, but maybe you'll like it.  What I wish was that you could have an aux input on the volume thing to plug in your ipod or something else.There you have it.  EnjoyMichael Peachey"",)"
"('I considered the Encounter set before deciding to try these. Something about 2 aliens looking at you all the time just isn\'t right.  Plus the Encounter bass unit is 50cm high!  Too big for my tastes.Other reviews mention lack of midrange and they\'re right. Of course there is no mid-speaker, so it was no surprise. I\'m a musician and audio recording engineer and can hear subtleties pretty well.The packing box is compact. The bass/base unit is on the top, the satellites & accessories are in the bottom.  Everything is wrapped in plastic, so don\'t expect instant gratification. The power brick is BIG: 6x7x10cm. Each satellite connector has a different shape so be sure you rotate it for a proper fit.The right satellite has the volume controls. I was able to detect 30 discrete steps between max volume and completely muted using the satellite controls.  The up button makes a TAP sound when you click it, the down button makes a TICK.  Hitting both at once mutes or restores the sound, and works reliably. I set it to max minus 3 clicks, then ran the volume from the Mac.The bass/base unit controls seem a bit consumer-ish: not flimsy but not entirely smooth and solid.  The power button is on the back.  The volume controls for both bass (left side) and treble (right) have a detent at the middle (5) point. I set each to about (6), then fired up iTunes.I used 4 types of music to test: a cappella, pipe organ, industrial/electronic, and jazz.  Each genre has highs, lows, dynamic range, and overtone interaction for evaluation of harmonics. I set flat equalizer at -12 to see where the bass crossed over to midrange by pushing each slide *one at a time* to +12. You get the bass unit *only* at 32, 64, 125, and 250hz.  You get treble *only* at 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, and 16khz.  The 500hz slider is the only crossover point!  Normally there\'s a bit more EQ range for the mids, but the isolation between satellites and bass is almost total.Normally my EQ settings are set like the Amazon swoosh - looks like a smile (try Classical or Rock in iTunes to see what I mean).  Based on my testing, I pushed up at 500 and 1khz and got a really nice overall setting.  Here\'s my new ""Creature"" preset: 32=+6, 64=+3,  125=+1.5, 250=0, 500=+7.5, 1k=+3, 2k=0, 4k=+1.5, 8k=+3, 16k=+4.5.I will never play these speakers even at half volume while sitting in front of them.  So I set iTunes volume to 50% and control the Mac\'s volume directly.  About 3 blocks out of the Mac\'s 16 is perfect for just sitting here.  I bump it up to about 7 blocks for working around the office.  Anything louder my wife insists needs to go on the home stereo. So points for volume impact.The cats don\'t mind the new bass or enhanced treble. The green LEDs on the satellites are a lot less intrusive than I expected, but I\'m still going to hack them and solder in blue ones eventually to match everything else.  Overall they\'re a keeper with a point each for looks, price, sound (bass/volume), and simplicity, and 1/3 point off each for midrange, consumerish controls, and power brick.',)"
"('I kinda feel sorry for the Lite-On company -- a scrappy Chinese (or maybe they\'re Korean) outfit which probably has visions of becoming a major brand by selling entry level products with great features @ competitive prices.  Unfortunately, they have a long way to go.""All-Write Technology"" -- the feature which supposedly allows you to write to discs of different formats -- should be renamed ""Rarely Writes Technology.""  The burner is extremely flickle regarding brands, and as other writers have mentioned, I\'ve already wasted $ on blank media.  Frankly between the $ I\'ve lost on Media, and the $ I\'m going to have to pay UPS to return the item & a restocking fee (alas, I didn\'t buy on Amazon) -- it probably adds up to the extra $100 I would have needed to buy something better.My biggest problem with the machine is a simple, simple feature my cheap VCR has, but this doesn\'t.  On my VCR, when you press record once, it setys a timer for 30 min, twice for 60 and so on.  That way, lets say you want to start taping an hour long episode of something and go out to dinner, it stops after the hour.  This thing will just keep recording until you press stop, or until the disc is full.  The problem is if you record until the disc is full, there\'s no room left on it to finalize -- a crucial step needed ot make it playable.Yes, the machine does have a 7 day timer, a la a VCR, so you\'d think you could solve the above problem by using this feature.  Except, when the timer goes off, you can\'t see what\'s being recorded (at least not if the input is via the S-Video in; haven\'t tried w/others).  I want to lay off programs from TiVo, but if I can\'t see what signal is coming through, I don\'t know when to press start/can\'t eliminate commercials.Finally -- the one recording that I was able to get to work, it didn\'t divide the item into chapters.  When I played the  movie, and hit chapter forward, it did click through at 10 minute intervals, but it didn\'t show these intervals on the menu.1 Star seems harsh, but I\'m putting it b/c a) right now the overall rating is too high & I want to bring the average down and b) I really wish I hadn\'t bought it.',)"

"('I won\'t bother to review the NSLU2 as a music server or criticise it because it uses the ext3 file system.  I don\'t really care that Linksys customer support sucks - all customer support for technical stuff like this is pretty abysmal.  Instead I will concentrate on what it does well and really IS - a low power, Linux computer with good IO support via USB and an active user community.  This product allows hands on experience with a compact (by necessity) but fairly modern and full-featured version of Linux (2.4.21).  The limited main memory (32 megabytes) and flash for boot (8 megabytes) enforces a discipline of compactness missing in the normal desktop with 1 gigabyte of main memory and a terabyte of disk storage.The Linksys WRT54GL wireless router is possibly the only other device out there with such an active user group.  It, however, has only half the main memory and no USB ports.  As a hackable Linux based router it is superb but it is less useful as a general purpose Linux box.The USB implementation is what makes the NSLU2 so expandable.  One may add hubs and hang all sorts of USB periperals such as RS232 converters, etc.  There are also easily accessible pinouts internally for I2C that is supported by the kernel.  This is a boon for those of us who want to buy cheap transducer chips from Digikey and Mouser and want to hook them up to a reasonably powerful computer for processing and storage.The UBW (Universal Bit Whacker), available from SparkFun.com for less than $20, provides an inexpensive way to add 20 general purpose IO lines and 10 bit AD conversion.  This tiny board contains a PIC micrcontroller that provides a USB connection and has firmware that makes it appear to the NSLU2 as an RS232 port.  To use it one simply opens a standard COM232 port and writes ascii character strings.  The PIC firmware is open source and completely modifiable using free tools provided by Microchip (the mfg. of the PIC).There is also a ProLogix USB to GPIB controller available for $150 that uses a FTDI USB to RS232 chip internally.  This allows an NSLU2 in a remote location to control all sorts of legacy GPIB equipment with full telnet or ssh access.  The NSLU2 idles at about 4 watts not including a hard drive.  By using flash memory sticks it is possible to have a remote monitoring setup running from solar panels with the NSLU2 firing up telemetry equipment as needed to make measurements and then powering them back down.  The low power draw of the NSLU2 allows it to run continuouslyOne can solder on a small IC made by Microchip to boot the NSLU2 when power is applied.  This is a real benefit since most of the commercial embedded Linux devices I have encountered require someone to manually restart the unit after power is lost and restored.  If you intend to have one of these at a remote location for telemetry you certainly don\'t want to drive fifty miles over fire roads just because power failed for ten minutes!While it is possible to upgrade to Linux 2.6 and a Debian distro, I haven\'t found it necessary yet. Instead I immediately ""unslung"" to version 6.10 beta so I can have room to store new programs.  ""Unslinging"" moves most of the operating system files from ram to a USB storage device.  I\'m using a 256 megabyte flash memory stick and still have 90% free.  After that simple upgrade I was able to use the ipkg program to download and install all sorts of precompiled packages directly over the web.  My first step was to get full featured versions of bash and busybox so that the user interface would be a bit more full featured.  There are thousands of programs available.  An embarrassment of riches.My next step is to install the toolchain on a desktop Linux box so I can write and compile programs for the NSLU2.The NSLU2 is a beautiful piece of equipment in the much the same way that my Marlin Glenfield Model 60 is a beautiful rifle.  The lines are clean and the design is minimalist.  True, it\'s just a mass produced 22 caliber plinker, but it\'s cheap to buy, cheap to use, nice to handle and for most of my shooting it\'s fine.  If you\'re not out for bear but just want to harass the occasional rat and gopher or maybe shoot a few wine bottles to get them ready for recycling, it\'s just the ticket.What makes the NSLU2 head and shoulders above just about everything else out there is the active support from the people at [...] as well as an active yahoo bulletin board.  The collective efforts of these folks have transformed a little plastic box not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes from a mediocre and rather buggy little file server into ""the little engine that could!""  My thanks to everyone out there who has shown that the ""tragedy of the commons"" is not a universal rule.  If you\'ve been thinking about learning Linux the ""real"" way - from the command line - and you don\'t want to have to wade through billions of bytes of fluff and cruft, here\'s the baby for you.  Under the hood Linux remains a powerful and fairly simple operating system capable of doing useful work in a small memory footprint on a slow, by today\'s standards, processor.Have fun!',)"
"('Almost everyone knows about Sennheiser\'s reputation but I\'ll say that it is one of the top brands up there making good headphones and other audio products in almost all price ranges. The HD-555 has been in production for quite some time. Despite that, they still have no direct successor model. This is an open design, which means the headphones leak sound in and out. So they\'re not very suitable for noisy environment or very quiet environments where the slightest sound could bother your neighbor (a library). This isn\'t a minus. Quite the contrary, most serious headphones models have an open air design.Build quality:They are almost completely made of plastic with big metal grills on the backs. You get mixed feelings when holding it the first time. They are heavy and solid enough to give you a good impression about durability. But, there is some plastic squeaking that steal a little confidence about the product\'s lastingness. Nothing serious, though. One of the major concerns about the HD-555 is the 1/4"" plug and its 1/8"" adaptor. If you plan to use this headphone plugged-in to a standard mini-jack, the adapter adds up a lot of bulk and could risk damaging either the port or the plug itself. The cable is very well made and feels very strong but also manageable. It is also considerable long (about 10 feet) and it\'s tangle-free.I have a major gripe about amazon\'s shipping. The headphones box came inside a cardboard box with no protection at all. Not good.Comfort factor:The Sennheiser HD-555 is a circumaural model, which means that the cushion pads go around your ears and not on them. Your ears feel free inside the cans and this is very comfortable. Since this is the first circumaural phones that I\'ve ever owned it felt a little weird at first, but now it\'s a total joy. I\'ve put them on for hours with no sign of fatigue. The cushion pads are of top quality materials but feel a little too firm the first times you wear them. The HD-555\'s are considered home headphones. So the cable length, the size and the big plug won\'t make them suitable for mobile purposes.Audio quality:This is where all the fun begins. I plugged them to my Auzentech x-Fi Prelude and a smile came to my face. I\'ve tried many headphones in the mid-low to low categories and I can safely say that these are the best sounding headphones I\'ve tried. Despite the size, the HD-555 can be easily driven. So you won\'t have any problem to enjoy this cans no matter what you connect them to.The HD-555\'s have a warm and dark sound signature. But it plays out right in a nice way. You\'ll get lots of detail and resolution from this baby but also it will uncover many flaws in your lossly ripped songs. The bass and low tones are very detailed and with great authority. The mids are delicious and the highs are not piercingly sharp, but very clear and smooth. The soundstage is incredibly wide, like you\'re hearing instruments from every different location. Every genre I\'ve thrown at them have given them the chance to shine. The HD-555\'s don\'t care if it\'s games, movies or music, they are awesome in all three of them. So, wrapping this up, I\'m very glad and satisfied with the Sennheiser HD-555. They\'re stuck like glue to my head, since I can\'t find a way to put them away (and I don\'t want to).',)"

"(""I'm hard of hearing.  Unfortunately, my wife can hear the earth move.  So it's been a bit of a struggle to listen to my favorite surround sound tv without bothering the family.  I'd tried a pair of RCA phones, but got constant drops and interference.  Then I heard about the Sennheiser from a friend.I read all of the reviews and looked at both the RS120 and the RS110.  The only difference I could see is that for forty bucks more I got rechargable batteries.  That might tally up over the coming months, but I took a chance on the 110.  And I'm glad I did.  I'm wearing them now, listening to tv.  Clear, clean reception within 10 feet of the tv and back to the bedroom which is about 50 feet or so, but there's also a brick wall and lots of air conditioning metal by the time I get back there.  Again, crystal clear reception.  Even in the back yard, though a trip to the dumpster out in the alley did stretch the range a tad.The head phones are very comfortable.  Adjustable even for my big head.  Sharp looking too.It's Thanksgiving today.  I've watched Detroit and Houston, The Red Skins and the Cowboys and now I'm into the second running of the Hatfields and Mccoys, so figure I've been watching and listening to the tv since 1 o'clock today.  It's 1130pm and my battery life is still long and strong (2 duracell aaa).Set up was easy but at first confusing.  The instruction booklet is pretty well simply read but it didn't tell me that with no audio input from the tv to the transmitter, that the transmitter shuts off (or in this case, didn't power on).  So keep that in mind when you plug it in and don't think like I did, that I'd gotten a lemon.  Hook it up, turn on the sound, make the speaker adjustment within your tv menu (my sony, an older model, allowed for tv speaker OR speaker output).  Works for me.I'd recommend these headphones to anyone seeking comfortable and quiet performance."",)"
"('The product is well packaged, looks very professional, and the charging system is unique and has worked well.The set was connected to a Sony 50"" rear-projection set in a location with no heavy wiring or metal objects, cement walls or ceiling and I\'m not happy with the reception since the sound can be distorted with some static or hum depending on whether I\'m watching a VCR tape or TV program 10-15\' away. The headphone acoustics isn\'t all that good in my opinion. I\'m really dissatisfied that one spot right in the middle of my lazy-boy that causes the sound to become distorted,  with a lot of white noise -- just a tilt or movement of the head either left or right. The height of the transmitter or moving it away from the TV location does not make any difference as does resetting to one of the other two channels on the transmitter.An apparent problem is when the input signal to its transmitter is too low, you mute the TV, pause the VCR, or a scenes is being shown that has a long silence, the base unit will shut down and a very loud static will blast your eardrums and that really hurts. This could be a big drawback if it depend on the TV volume alone since the purpose of using them in the first place is to turn the volume down. It does shut down on occasion for no apparent reason.On occasions, as with many wireless products, there is occasionalinterference and I have received the next door neighbor talking on their phone which is a cordless but I don\'t know their frequency. Our 800mh phone does not interfere and there is no other wireless items round except garage door opener devices.The headset fits pretty well and is comfortable for extended wear but is slightly larger than I like for my head size 7. It certainly tends to slip around to much or fall off when nodding your head. They could have improve the ear pieces by cupping them so they fit around the ears instead of the fitted flat covers used.Too much interference for a $70 device in my opinion.Update 10/18/09: Had to use the manufacturer warranty on 9/21/09 since the charging system failed. Just received today a confirmation that the unit is being replaced and that Seenheiser is mailing a new replacement.First edit: Everything above still stands after receiving my replacement. But, the reception and sound tracking is really, really better than the first set. I took the covers and foam rubber off the ear pieces and cut out a circle from the foam rubber so that the phone pieces more or less fit around the ears. After replacing the covers and the foam rubber circles the headset fits a lot better and doesn\'t fall off to often. Now why couldn\'t they think of that.Update 5/30/12: The two paragraphs above with stood the time until today when the receiver base GREEN light no longer lights when attached to its source nor is there any sound in the headphones other than white noise. Checking every single thing to see if there was a connection problem of some sort I found nothing had changed and unplugging and re-plugging didn\'t help. Still no reception so guess the RS120 is shot. Lasted just over three years before failing with absolutely no abuse.',)"
"(""Everything has been said in 922 previous reviews . I found a headphone jack 3.5 mm jack for the computer and a set of RCA audio jacks in my package . I have Fibro and severe chronic pain . Zero quality of life until I put these on WOW . I own a acre and a third with a house at one far end . I walked to every point on my property after closing the door to the house and setting these up on the wall 3 feet above my computer and had no problems until I ducked behind a old Wells cargo trailor 400 feet away . Otherwise I did get some crackle but it was no worse then old vinyl scratches . My garage is behind the house I walked in with closed the doors and there was a van between me and the house and I heard everyting fine . The charging cradle is fine . Its easy to change the batteries and it came with rechargeables . Bottom line it works well . Sounds were crisp within reason for the crackles and pops . It scared me to think the radio waves were everywhere . I thought the bass was great . I like the position of the dials its not confusing . There is a adjustment on the base that helped me lock in a signal everywhere . Now the bad .These headphones are for people sitting or walking easy . When I tried to bend over with them they fell off . I didnt get on my lawn mower but it would be about as far as I would push activity with them . They feel clumsy and akward for me and I imagine most people . I wore them as small as they would go and I am a 7 5/8 hat size . Maybe my ears are high on my head I dont know . Compared to the technology I knew these are a 6 but take two off for a 4 on a 5 point scale . Definitely worth the money but dont expect to do work in them you will have to find another model . I would love to hear what people are using for that . The range for me was unbelievable compared to what I expected . I never believed the claims . Now you do have to tune them in and adjust a little . My base was hung on a simple paneling nail on the wall above the computer with a light switch a foot away , air conditioner running , monitors , tv and a wireless phone system . No problems . The volume turns up just high enough to be pleasant yet safe . A very good purchase . These replaced a nice set of RCA's which sadly were lost before the package was even openned . I couldnt buy them again and I dont feel sad anymore . I would buy again but hopefully the other pair will be something for working outside now that I know the tech can reach out there . These would be great for landscapers just leave the truck radio on with the base plugged into a inverter 12vt charge pack . I will comment later as I havent tried them with tv or just the computer alone yet to run into issues where people complain of the auto shut off / gain feature . I cant wait to try these with a usb phono I bought recently for my old 45's ,78's and 33's . For one brief moment my pain was bearable it was worth the money . Please recomend in comments a headset that may work with the base or not that is wearable while bending or being more active . Thanks ..God Bless ."",)"

"(""I have loved sennheiser products. I think if it weren't for dealing with interference, these could be a decent product. However, if you are in any environment with any type of wireless interference, these will degrade the audio to the point of not even being worth listening to. Tuning can only bring the hiss to a lower level and not by any means make it unnoticeable. I am by no means an audiophile, but these are unacceptable."",)"
"(""With young children in the apartment, I can finally listen to TV programs or the radio while doing chorse after they have gone to bed.  The sound quality is good enough, and they feel comfortable (after trying a few adjustments).  The re-charging stand is handy not only for recharging, but to give a 'home' for the headset to be placed after every use.  Static is minimal.  It helps to have the source volume high, and then use the headphone volume control to control the final sound output.  The wife and I are very happy about the Sennheiser RS120."",)"

"('I own a pair of Sennheiser 170\'s and they are really excellent headphones but @ over $200 I didn\'t want to spend as much since major use of these 120\'s was my bedroom TV. PS, if you\'re buying a tv these days, be careful to check the back before buying. Most decent size LCDs/plasma\'s don\'t have headphone jacks, many do not have RCA audio outputs, and some cheap models don\'t even have optical outputs. I\'m not sure how optical to RCA converters worked, so, I wanted one with RCA audio out in addition to optical, and second choice would be headphone jack. In my humble opinion, RCA-output is the best because there is constant output level and you then control the TV speakers with the mute button on your remote. If you are limited to a headphone jack, the speakers usually are cut out when the phones are plugged in making it necessary to be plugging and unplugging whenever you use the phones and then want to go back to the speakers. Back to the 120\'s. First of all - sound quality is excellent, tho I don\'t use them primarily for music, I\'d have no hesitation to do so. Unlike the 170 and 180\'s they don\'t have features like base boost nor do they have the surround sound simulation that the 170/180\'s have. PS: this feature on the 170\'s is really cool and I love using them on my family room tv for action movies. But, back to the 120\'s: even without these features, the sound is great. Next, reception: unbelievable. I\'ve been all over my house to test them and they work great, even on different floors. Next: comfort. I actually really like the ""on the ear"" fit for my purposes. Soft pads, no irritation, but haven\'t yet worn for hours. I can say that, since I have both, there is one advantage of these compared with ""over the ear"" fit that is a feature of the 170\'s. With over the ear, if your head is resting on a cushion/pillow such that the cushion/pillow pushes on the earpiece, it causes the earpiece to put pressure on the back of your ear and actually can cause irritation. It\'s my one complaint (albeit minor) about my 170\'s. The one problem wiht the ""on ear"" fit of the 120\'s is that it is not ""secure"" - i.e, because they fit lightly and comfortably, if you want to wear them while you\'re say doing a project that requires bending over, they\'ll tend to slip off your head/ears. If you\'re sitting, at your computer, lying down for a nap, no problem. But if you\'\'re going to be active with them - like working in the garage or cleaning the house while wearing them, might consider the more secure fit of over the ear. Since they\'re not over the ear, they\'re not as noise isolating, but that can be an advantage if you want to know what\'s going on around you - like hearing your wife calling you or the doorbell, etc. Finally, as for some of the criticisms of others that I\'ve seen posted on these reviews, here\'s my take:1. Hiss: non existent. none. I\'m using these with RCA outputs on my tv that have constant output and in this mode 0 hiss at any volume even with total silence on the source. If you\'re using headphone jack output, probably should have the component volume up enough (normal listening level) so you don\'t have to crank the phones - but I\'ve pushed the volume on these during silence on screen without any hiss!!2. Unable to charge with earpieces extended. Huh? Maybe they\'ve changed the design of base unit, but this is simply NOT true. I\'ve extended them all the way and set on the base to charge. No problemo.3. Volume control on same side as tuning wheel. Please.4. Auto on/off. So far no problem while watching TV.  I suppose if you\'re pausing dvd\'s frequently, this could be a minor annoyance, but if you\'re wearing wireless headphones the need to pause should be minimal, since you can keep listening while you grab a beer in the kitchen or take care of business in the bathroom! Here\'s the bottom line on this: I TURNED THE TV OFF AND CLOCKED THE TIME-TO-AUTO-SHUTOFF: 3 minutes exactly. So.. how can this be a problem listening to music: suggest if this a problem you are using a headphone jack and the component volume is set incredibly low, turn it up a bit! Oh, yeah, when the base is off, then turn the tv on, the time between tv volume ""on"" and base unit auto on is virtually instantaneous.  Again if, not getting this performance, suspect it is headphone jack and component volume problem.Overall: this is a great set of wireless headphones at a reasonable price (less than $100 on amazon) and the problems noted by others have either been engineered out of the product over the years (some of the negative reviews are years old), or the folks with problems haven\'t set them up correctly (using headphone jack with component volume turned too low). For best results, try the rca audio outputs and if you\'re going to buy a new tv, look for and get a tv that has this feature!',)"

"('Has great distance before a hiss starts to invade the clear audio. Headphones always charge--at least the charge light stays on when they are in holder, They charge might actually stop at full charge--I do not know, 3 frequency channels available if one is picking up some noise, or another channel is being used nearby. No such problems for me, so no report on cross-talk between frequencies. Real good frequency response----audio quality quite good. 2 aaa batteries easily pop under one earphone cover, and last forever, being rechargeable. A bit difficult to keep on head when bending over. Very slight pressure against my ears allows them to slide off, but if they had tight pressure, you\'d surely get a headache. Have these on for hours sometimes and no discomfort. Use for a computer internet radio station, online storage music site, tv stereo audio--as other people in house use headphones, too, so anyone without them, have silence. Only use headband over top of head, as behind head, they\'d slip right off. Green light shows when audio is present. Volume control on one ear. Also control to tune in audio for selected frequency. Another switch is on/off. Directions tell how to reset audio if lost. Unplug unit. Uninstall batteries then reinstall.  Hardly happens, though.  headphone AUDIO stops, get a hiss, so turn them off ! Hiss not heard at all when audio is present. Music and voice sound normal-------for sure, not tinny. No need to go sennheiser digital, though--since you\'ll also lose some wireless distance. Signal goes through walls, easily--never thought wireless could be so good.  Perhaps adding a personal chin strap to earphones on both sides, could keep them on when bending.  Headband very sturdy throughout. Sennheiser is QUALITY. UPDATE=UPDATE=UPDATE = I WAS ASKED ABOUT volts AND adapter--Must use 2 1.5 volt AAA battery rechargables in earpiece--long lasting. Input cord end from headphone cradle that plugs into output source is stereo RCA plugs that go to an adapter that goes to 3.5 mm (1/8"") plug, that CAN then go to included adapter for phono plug if needed.',)"
"('These headphones work great. They\'re Sennheisers and you usually can\'t go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I\'ll get to that).I\'ve been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It\'s great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won\'t become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won\'t go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a ""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter"". Make sure the adapter is a ""stereo"" adapter versus a ""mono"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I\'ve read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here\'s a quick ""What to do"":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I\'m using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you\'re connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you\'re connected to the receiver/amp\'s line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You\'ve been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won\'t need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn\'t strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device\'s volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They\'re pretty nice.',)"

"(""The Powershot S1 has all the features of my old Canon A60, but the 10x zoom with image stabilizer sold me. No more blurred photos! The diopter on the viewfinder is another unique feature that this bi-focaled person appreciates. Adjust it to your vision and images are focused perfectly in the viewfinder. The LCD screen can be flipped in different positions, which is handy.  Bonus: fold it down to keep it from getting scratched and full of fingerprints. It's a tad smaller than I'm accustomed to, but suffices.  The pop-up flash is handy, and again, is less likely to get damaged when down. The lens cap, when tethered to the neckstrap, pops right off when you turn the camera on. No more losing lens caps or getting the lens dirty and scratched. (Yes, I'm tough on my cameras.)The 3.2 MP size is perfectly suited to 8x10 or smaller photos. You don't need more than that for casual or semi-professional use. The 32 MB memory card is adequate, but purchase a 512 MB compactflash card and you are set.  Yes, it eats batteries, but purchase a set of rechargeable batteries and charger and you are set to go. I even bought an inverter for my car so that I can plug in the charger when on trips. The video feature is nice, but we use it rarely.The biggest selling points, for me, were:- Canon brand; reliable and well-built, good customer service- Compactflash memory; inexpensive and easy to find- uses AA batteries, not a proprietary battery- 10x zoom; get those close-up shots you can't get with a 3x- image stabilizer; people with shaky hands love this- Flip out LCD view screen- easy-to-use menus and controls- many settings available on top dial- manual focus available when in low-light- ability to add on wide-angle and telephoto lenses and filters- optional remote control- quiet operation; zoom and shutter not noisy like the A60- tripod mount on bottom- unit is not too bulky or heavy and fits in most camera bags- best features for digital camera in this price range[...]"",)"
"('Update: A year on the camera still works fine. It\'s still too slow for any sort of action shot and there\'s no way to put it into shutter priority so far as I can tell. As a belt camera I still haven\'t found anything better and it\'s showing very little sign of wear from being with me every day. Battery life is still very good. However, the slow reaction of the camera has driven me to buy an EOS-20D. I can\'t take it everywhere but it\'s way better for any form of action. Curiously some of my best scenic shots are still with the S500. Would I buy it again? Only if I couldn\'t get something the same size with shutter priority and faster reactions to the shutter release.After a couple of weeks of taking pictures and experimenting with settings I\'d say this is good, great in many circumstances, but not perfect.Some of the issues are just limitations of the form factor, the form factor was the deciding point in my choice of cameras. Perhaps I had some unrealistic expectations of the ability of technology to overcome physics?Basically, with a 5M pixel sensor and a tiny little lens you don\'t get fast shutter speeds unless you either have excellent lighting or use the flash. Fortunately the flash is perhaps unexpectedly powerful, so most indoor shots can be well lit and fill-in can be used outdoors, though you seem to have to go to manual mode to force the flash to be used.The battery seems to last well even when using the flash. Some reviews say you need to use one battery while charging another. Well, I don\'t know what they were doing, I meant to change the battery yesterday morning and the camera is still going strong today, I think that\'s about 150 pictures since I last changed the battery for the spare. Batteries still have memory effect even though it is less pronounced than with NiCd technology of the past, the NiMH battery in the laptop I am using now has only half the capacity it should.Anyway, back to the camera. The metering system isn\'t clairvoyant, it does sometimes pick the wrong subject, especially in backlit conditions which is why I know about forcing it to use fill-in floash.Indoor shots without the flash will often be blurred, I took one just after landing in Chicago ORD and there was a lot of blurred motion on walking people though I had managed to hold the camera steady as the background was sharp. If you don\'t use the red-eye reduction mode on the flash you will get amazing red-eye.I use a 512Mb Sandisk Ultra II that I picked up for about $120, that gives me about 350 shots in fine mode. The speed of the card hasn\'t really been a noticeable benefit the way I have used the camera.The colors are good, I\'m not certain they are great, I have a suspicion they are a little blue. Certainly blue scenes seem very blue.Speaking of blue... my old Olympus shows red flares to the right of bright edges, so a white light will have a red halo to the right. On a couple of shots the S500 has shown a blue halo to the left, one example was a person standing with their back to a very brightly lit window, even though he was correctly exposed. Perhaps fill-in flash would have fixed this, but that would have given some red-eye.In summary, this camera has shown me that there\'s no substitute for big pieces of glass even in the modern day, the lens is still the most important part of a camera. My old Olympus 3040z with an f1.8 lens was much more effective in low light... but I never had it with me when I wanted to take a picture ""right now"". The S500 in the small belt pouch with the 512Mb compact flash has proven sufficient for about 3 days of casual photography. However, if I want to take memorable and sharp scenic shots I\'m going to have to bite the bullet and buy the EOS10D. I hear now that the S410 may have better low light performance, so perhaps I\'ll sell my S500 and try that instead.',)"
"('I own a 20D which I absolutely love and was getting tired of lugging it around and was therefore looking for a good digital point and shoot. My two major candidates were the S500 and the S70.If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S500 vs the S60/70. The S60/70 offers excellent manual controls while the S500 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation. I just LOVE the look and feel of the S500 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small. If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.The S500 is simply beautiful. I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 20D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don\'t want to lug the 20D around.Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S60/70 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size. This is a very good argument! The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S70. The form and size factors are what finally won me over.One criticism of the camera. Low light focusing is less than ideal. You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.  Also, battery life could be better, but that\'s the price you pay for such a small camera.The sensor size of the S500 is the same as that of the S60 and the S70 - 1/1.8"".  This is an ideal size for a point and shoot IMO.  The 1/2.5"" sensor used in the smaller SD series cameras represents a poor image quality trade off.  Stick with the larger sensor which give less noise, chromatic aberration, and better image quality.I purchased the leather Elph case which protects the camera well and only adds insubstantially to the bulk.  Some have complained that prior iterations of this camera scratch easily.  I\'ve owned them and found that if you keep the camera in a case and exercise modest caution that the camera will remain pristine.The pictures are just fantastic!  Color saturation is superb and the file size is sufficient that you can crop moderately with little negative impact.  Other than in low light the camera locks onto its subject quickly and accurately.One other consideration:  The S700 will undoubtedly be hitting the streets soon.  It will employ the larger Sony sensor used by the S70 which gives fantastic results.  It might be worth your while waiting.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon currently represents the state of the art.',)"
"('When I first saw this camera, I thought to myself, ""Kodak has finally gotten it right."" Ever since they started making digital cameras, Kodak has had, in my opinon, some of the best picture quality available. The metering has always been dead-on and the pictures, although somewhat over-saturated, have always featured deep, sharp colors and extraordinary clarity. The only thing that prevented me from buying a Kodak digital camera was the fact that their bodies were cheaply made out of lightweight plastic. Then they moved into the Easy Share line of cameras geared to the entry-level market and things went from bad to worse with the camera styles getting progressively larger and the bodies getting progressively cheaper.But with the release of the LS753 (and its 4 MP younger brother the LS743), Kodak finally smartened up and made an ultra-compact, sleek, attractive, sturdy camera geared to the mid-level user. And the camera is every bit as nice as it looks on the internet. The LS753 is a slick little device. Weighing in at just under 6 oz. (without battery) and measuring just larger than a deck of cards, this camera is small enough and light enough to easily fit in your pocket or comfortably fit on your belt. The body is made of high impact plastic and features a metallic front that gives the camera a sturdy feel without making it too heavy or bulky. It\'s finished in a metallic silver with just a hint of blue tones which, in my opinion, makes for a very attractive color. Ergonomically, everything is exactly where it should be and the camera feels very comfortable in your hand. One of the nicest features is the inclusion of a button on top of the camera to quickly change flash settings. Also, the camera features a small dial on top, right in front of the shutter button, which allows you to change camera modes. The default setting is always automatic so you never have to worry about accidently setting the dial somewhere you don\'t want it and then having it in the wrong position when the camera starts up. All in all, this is a perfect design. But, unfortunately, the positive features end there.As I said, I was fully expecting that this camera would have taken beautiful pictures, based on my past experience with Kodak. I mean, with today\'s technology, picture quality should only be getting better, right? Wrong. Here\'s why:1. The pictures, although clear and crisp in bright light, are far too dark when taken with the flash. But the problem is not consistent and it has everything to do with the automatic ISO and speed settings that the camera uses.  At equal distances, some of the flash pictures will be far too dark and some will be acceptable. It seems that the shutter is very fast, but maybe too fast for the size of the lens and the power of the flash. It seems to me, for the majority of the automatic flash pictures, that the camera is not letting enough light in. In fairness, you do have manual control over some of these settings (exposure and ISO) and I\'m sure, with some tweaking, you can get closer to the right mix. But, for this size camera, why should we be concerned with such things? This is a point-and-shoot, and you expect to be able to do just that.2. The flash is far too small for the camera and, more often than not, you will find that it will light up only the very closest objects. This gives the unpleasant effect of having only half of your pictures illuminated. Coupled with the problem above, the bottom line is that flash pictures are not at all acceptable for this price camera. When compared to my Canon S40, which is a similar compact camera, there just is no comparison. The Kodak is just not acceptable for indoor use.3. The camera features a 1.8"" LCD display which is crisp, sharp, and easy to see even in bright places. However, it has one major flaw which is that the pictures appear much more dull and dark on the LCD screen then they do when viewed on a computer. (Even the ones that actually are dull and dark as described above are FAR worse when viewed on the LCD screen). This can actually be a difficult adjustment in the beginning because, when previewing pictures on the screen, you may be inclined to discard pictures that you think are too dark, only to find out that they would have been acceptable (or close to it) when viewed on a computer.4. The low battery indicator is not at all obvious, with just a very small flashing white icon in the far bottom corner of the LCD screen. Maybe I\'m not paying enough attention, but I almost never see it. And it seems to comes on just before the battery actually dies. The end result is that the battery dies and the camera shuts down as a surprise. And not a pleasant one.5. The autofocus is terrible, particularly in lower light conditions. You will find that you have to discard about 10% of your pictures because of blur, even with the most steady of hands. This is beacuse the camera was made to point and shoot very quickly without having to wait for the camera to autofocus. And, 90% of the time, it does fine. But for the other 10%, it is very frustrating. I would rather have the camera autofocus for a second or two and beep when it is in focus so that I know the picture is ready to be taken. Not having to wait is a nice feature, but you have no idea what the end result will be. I have also had problems with the camera focusing on the wrong subject. For example, just today I took a family portrait using the auto-timer and the picture was blurry. Obviously it had nothing to do with movement because neither us, nor the camera were in motion. It just has to do with, again, bad internal automatic settings.Is it all bad? Well, not really. As I said, the design is great. And if it had better guts, the camera would be perfect. One thing I love is the comapct battery charger that plugs right into the wall. I wish more camera/camcorder manufacturers would catch on to the fact that we consumers like to remove the battery and put it into a separate wall charger without having to lug around wires, an AC transformer, etc. Kodak has gotten this part right. I also recommend the separate custom made leather case that they sell. This fits the camera snugly and offers a lot of protection in a very compact package. One last positive note is the battery life. I had one fully charged battery last through approximately 150 flash pictures and it had plenty of life to spare. This is a very positive feature for this size camera.In fairness, I have not tested this camera with the docking station or with any of the EasyShare software which is supposed to be a major selling point of this Kodak line. I am just not that type of user. I prefer to remove the SD card and load my pictures to my computer using a card reader where I can manipulate them. But, even if these EasyShare features are flawless, it would not make up for the lousy flash pictures and the all too often blur. Nothing, not even ergonomic design, can make up for bad pictures. And, unfortunately, that\'s just what this camera takes.What if you only use it outdoors? Well, then this camera would be a winner. But, I\'ll go out on a limb and say that the majority of the point-and-shoot market will not be limiting themselves to outdoor shots. That said, Kodak really missed the mark on this one. Which is really dissapointing to me because they passed up a golden opportunity to make the perfect digital camera.Back to the drawing board...',)"
"(""I just purchased this as a replacement from my Sony P-72 3.2 meg camera.  WOW!  This camera is so much more improved from only a couple years ago.  Aside from the 5.1 megapixel count, this camera excels in almost every conceivable area relevant to compacts.First off, this camera starts up in less than a second or so--truly fast compared to other similarly priced cameras.  This feature is essential when attempting to capture that oh so special kodak...er...sony moment in a blink.Secondly, the camera is beautiful.  Sony got it right this time when designing a sturdy, compact and lightweight technological masterpiece.  True, it's not as small as its even lighter cousin--the T-1, or the Pentax Optio S4i and Casio Ex-z4, but it passes the pants pocket test with flying colors. Additionally, when compared to the T-1, this camera uses the regular memory stick size and not the smaller duo like the T-1. Sooooo, if you already own a sony, this is a natural upgrade.Some other excellent features on the P-100 are the manual overides.  You can adjust the shutter speed and aperature which, for a camera in this class, is a true rarity.Unlike the T-1, this cam does have a tripod mount, a no brainer for any serious photographer.  I also am enjoying the extremely high quality video mode; although not the most important selling point, having the ability to take camcorder like videos with sound for unlimited amounts of time (unlike 30 second segments from many other cams) is handy.Another amazing feature is the battery life.  I remember my first sony digital camera--the DSC-P50 2.1 mega pixel.  It's battery life was dismal.  My P-72 was slightly improved, but still suffered from chronic battery munchies.  The P-100 fully charged can take pictures for over 200 minutes!  If you're on the display modes, it can last almost double that--another breathtaking accomplishment.  The info lithium works well in calculating the remaining battery life--a major complaint from owners of other cameras like Canon that lack this feature.  Lastly, it is a proprietary battery, so purchasing an additional one is recommended.Needless to say, the 1.8&quot; lcd is gorgeous, just like the past sony cameras I've had.  It's extremely hi-res and I have no difficulty seeing it in sunlight.  The lcd's navigation is similar to earlier sony cams with a few new additions like a light metering box.Overall, I'm tremendously pleased with the picture quality from this puppy.  I envision this camera lasting well into early-mid 2005 when Sony will release yet another improvement.  Until then, I highly recommend this for most anybody who appreciates quality and functionality incorporated into a lightweight package."",)"
"('Update 7/2009:I don\'t believe that I am still using the W1. After 5 years and thousands of pictures, this Sony still works like new.  No problem no nothing at all.  I\'ve upgraded to a Nikon D40 but I am still using the Sony very often. The D40 is just too big and heavy.  The picture from the Sony is still very good. The color from the Sony is very good. Just make sure you have the flash turned on at all time and condition, the picture will come out sharp and clean.  One big problem I have noticed over the years is that the picture from the Sony (when set to 5.1MP) is not 3:2  This is a big problem when I take the memory card to print at Costco. Costco chop the pictures from the top and bottom because the pictures are square at 5.1MP; not 3:2.  If you are planning to print the pictures, make sure you set the Sony to ""3:2""; not ""5.1MP"".I have been playing with this camera for 2 days.The speed is amazing. I can keep shooting and shooting with very fast shutter speed.  I turn the camera on and I can take picture right away. There is virtually no waiting from shoot to shoot.The camera is small but has a nice weight; and have a pretty good grip.It is very easy to learn and use.Compared the picture quality with my 3.1M Kodak, the DSC-W1 takes much better picture. My Kodak is pretty good but this Sony is awesome!And they cost the same.  The store has $40 off with this Sony. What a deal.The AE Illuminator is great.  I took a picture of my flower out side in complete darkness. The picture came out sharp and bright.But taking picture in door is very tricky. If the flash doesn\'t come on when taking picture in door, the picture is very fuzzy most of the time even the room has enough light (enough light to tell the camera not to use the flash).  But if I force the flash to turn on (even the room is bright enough), the picture comes out very sharp.  Never has this problem with my Kodak.  My Kodak can take very good picture in any condition except where it is very dark.May be the len doesn\'t let enough light to pass through.  Basically, in any condition (in door or out door; from dusk to dawn), if the flash doesn\'t come on, the pictures are usually dark and fuzzy.2 AA Alkaline lasts about 30 minutes. So, make sure you have enough batteries with you.  The rechargable that comes with the camera lasts a whole lot longer.  Sony gives me 20% discount after I register the camera in their website.  So, I will be getting the starter kit that comes with extra batteries.Using Memory Stick doesn\'t bother me since there is always something new every year.  And copying pictures to my computer is very fast.  I can just copy the pictures to my Compact Flash memory and take the CF to the store for the prints.The only bad thing is the software. It has no usefull feature but to let you copy and view the pictures from the camera. I can easily copy the pictures to my computer without the software since XP sees the camera as a disk drive; or you can set the USB mode to on-line camera mode (PTP) and XP sees it as a camera.Overall, one of the best point-and-shoot camera.  Just make sure you turn on the flash at ALL TIME.  And trash the 32meg memory stick that comes with the camera and get at least a 256meg memory stick pro.',)"

"('Yes, the world is going digital and VCR\'s are quickly becoming dinosaurs. In fact, this most likely will be my last one. Why am I buying a new VCR in 2004? Simple, I needed something to record my sports & TV shows and I simply couldn\'t beat the value of a Hi-Fi VCR.I bought this model at a local retailer for 60$!! Amazon\'s price (58$) wasn\'t enough of a discount for me to want to wait for the shipping, sorry amazon. DVR\'s are nice and easy to use, but I  was not interested in a monthly fee (ranges 60-156$/yr.) DVD recorders are clearly the future, especially those w/ built-in hard drives, but are still way overpriced !! I\'ll be patient and wait until they come down to earth.I researched VCR\'s are found a nice Sony model(SLVN750), but it was 20$ more(80$). Sony\'s have always seemed overpriced. That model was actually the most expensive Hi-Fi VCR I found out there.Anyways, I\'ve always liked Panasonics and have been satisfied with their products before. In fact, Panasonic is #1 in terms of reliablity for VCR\'s, they also make reliable DVD players by the way. I won\'t try to compare the picture between VCRs(analog) and DVDs(digital). I\'ll just say that the picture is acceptable. The sound from playback on a Hi-Fi(stereo/2 channel)VCR is actually quite good, I was impressed.Make sure you use the RCA(composite) A/V inputs for hook up. I\'d actually recommend Monster Cable RCA\'s - they are spendy yes, but worth it. Panasonic offers a similiar, slighty more expensive model to this one, the #PV-V4624S, the main differences are that one is wider and offers a ""light tower"" remote. S-VHS(or Super VHS) machines are nice because they offer higher resolution(and an S-Video out), however they are 3X the price of a Hi-Fi 4 head model and I simply could not justify spending that much on a VCR.Some things I like about this model are it has a very small remote(though boxy designed), commercial skip button (1,2,or 3 min. fast forward)-though it\'s not placed in an easy to locate/handy area and confusingly labeled ""CM/ZERO"". I feel they should\'ve made the record button red to help it stand out more on the remote. It features auto clock set, on-screen programming, energy star, universal remote (for VCR & TV only), memory back-up, front inputs, 1 year warranty(90 day labor).My complaints are: the construction of the sides and back are now plastic instead of metal, guess Panasonic is trying to cut costs. The two included manuals are horrible. Also, I wish this was available in black as all of my other A/V electronics are. Though loud, this thing is incredibly fast at rewinding too! We are talking mere seconds. SP & SLP recording only... what happened to LP mode? Doesn\'t matter to me, I always use SP mode anyways(better picture & sound).In closing, VCRs are versatile and still the most inexpensive way to play, record, and keep videos, even in 2004--05! I recommend this product to those also looking for an alternative way to record.',)"
"('First, I won\'t attempt to give as comprehensize of a review as  Eduardo gave.  I pretty much agree with EVERYTHING he said.  This system is really awesome, esp considering the price tag.  I\'m REALLY impressed with the performance, sound clarity, features, functionality (HDMI, etc) at this price point.  I\'m almost certain that you can\'t do better for under $300.  On that basis alone, this is easily worth 5 stars.However I need to echo something Eduardo mentioned briefly, and expand on it a bit.  First, digital amplification sounds  little different that what you\'re probably used to hearing from analog amps.  Some folks hate digital, others love it.  But all opinions aside, you\'d be wise to test this out with your speakers and the rest of your home theater system before you decide to buy (or be ready to send back to amazon if you don\'t like it).  For sure, this system doesn\'t sound that good when you pair it with certain speakers.I have a pair of Cerwin Vega VS120s, which are AWESOME speakers, but this amp just can\'t drive them properly.  The sound is just terrible.  So I put my VS120s back on my older stereo amp (120W/ch) and hooked up the rest of my home theater speakers to the Panny.  The rest of my speakers are lower power Cerwin Vegas (5"" fronts, 4"" surrounds/rears, 5"" center, 100W subwoofer) and they sound just GRAND.I decided the best solution for me was to use the Panny for watching movies (on my lower power speakers) and use my old stereo amp for my higher power VS120s.I\'m sure other folks will notice that this amp is overall an AWESOME value and a fantastic performer for $299, but you should also be ready to make sure you\'re not putting it into a home theater setup that it\'s just not well-suited to.Otherwise, I\'d recommend dropping the $299 on this, it\'s really an exceptional piece of equipment.  When did Panny learn to make good audio equipment, anyway?  ;)',)"

"(""...keep your expectations low!For a cheap shelf system this Sony can certainly crank...BUT with an ungodly amount of distortion and resulting listener fatigue above 50% volume mainly due to the lousy speakers (typical of all shelf systems) and subwoofer.  Keep in mind though that 90% of mass manufacturers like Sony, Phillips and Panasonic routinely inflate their watts-per-channel numbers to pull in the naive and uneducated consumer...Sony claims that the speakers do 125 wpc and the subwoofer 150 wpc but when you consider how quickly the sound distorts as you increase the volume, more realistic numbers would be closer to 40 wpc for the speakers and 70 wpc for the subwoofer.  Still impressive compared to the shelf systems of just 10 years ago, which had no subwoofer and were barely pushing 15 watts per channel---but no comparison to what even the cheapest low-end component stereo system can do!The subwoofer does not have its independent volume control so it does a good job as long as you stay well under 50% volume, go beyond that and it overpowers the music with its muddy boominess.  At low to moderate volumes the subwoofer does a decent job, though.  I ended up turning my subwoofer sideways away from the corner of the room where the shelf system sits, which did help to lessen the bucket-like boominess.All of the above is normal at this price point, right?  Well yes and no.  Compared to similar offerings in this price range by Panasonic and Phillips (I won't even mention all the Walmart off-brands) this Sony more than holds its own---in fact if those were the only choices I'd take this one in a heartbeat.HOWEVER...if you know where to look you can get a MUCH better component system for just an extra hundred bucks or so!  Go to jandr dot com for entry level Onkyo or Sherwood stereo receivers under a hundred dollars, DVD/CD players like the Toshiba 3960 for fifty dollars and bookshelf speakers like the Polk R15 or JBL E20 for one hundred a pair.  (As for a tape deck who on earth even uses cassettes anymore these days?)  This setup by itself will already sound three times better than any all-in-one compact system costing three to four hundred dollars, even without a sub.  If you must add a sub you can start with a cheap one hundred dollar Yamaha (or even better, a Dayton sub from partsexpress dot com) that will blow away this Sony's sub.About the only justifiable reason to get any compact shelf stereo is if you are truly pressed for space and money, and if you only listen to music (not too closely) at low to moderate volumes.With any compact system you will get a very limited range of sound-shaping options, for example this Sony only has 3 preset equalizer settings instead of allowing you to set bass and treble manually, and there is no balance control.  Also because everything has to fit within a tiny little box, there is bound to be more electronic noise and interference in the signal as the miniaturized parts are crammed much closer together, which is why the sound becomes fuzzier the louder you play music, and the unit can heat up if pumped at high volumes over any extended period of time.  Most importantly, there are much fewer connectivity options, meaning you can't hook up as many different things (video games, TV, VCR, PC, iPod, etc.) into the shelf system at the same time as you can into a standalone receiver...for instance with this Sony you only have one set of auxilary inputs.So that's why I think the extra hundred or so dollars would be extremely well spent.  But then again, if you absolutely cannot go over two hundred, this Sony is a very good choice in this class."",)"
"(""I have been a Nikon user for over 20 years, and owned at least six different bodies and lots of lenses. My all time favorite is the FM2N. Why Nikon? It's the lenses! Nikon seems to understand this is the main selling point of their system. SO they have never changed the F lens mount. You can use older manual focus AI and AIS lenses on the D70. The bad news: The meter won't work. However on a digital SLR, the LCD confirmation mitigates this since you can check your exposures. You could also use a handheld light light meter. More good news: depth of field preview works with AI and AIS lenses! So I've been having a great time using my manual lenses on the D70. This camera is really a winner and costs no more than some of the ridiculous &quot;prosumer&quot; digicams out there. It's far more versatile.It's easy to use-if you've used another digicam or even a recent Nikon 35mm SLR. The fact that I've been able to figure out most settings necessary without even cracking the manual is impressive.The flash syncs at 1/500! This makes for some really creative fill flash outdoors or in the studio. All necessary settings are within easy reach, and no stupid five click deep menus for stuff like ISO. All the important stuff like ISO, Metering pattern, Exposure modes, White Balance, etc. have a dedicated button right on the body. No fumbling to change stuff while shooting.Shutterlag is virtually non-existent. It's almost as good as my FM2N. But face it, if you want zero shutter lag then get a manual 35mm camera! However with the D70, you will not notice it.The Lens-the kit lens is a 18-70mm (27 to 105mm). It's pretty good, and the color has that gorgeous Nikon hue. It's bright for a zoom. A lot of people are criticizing this lens unjustly. It does have a lot of barrel distortion on the wide end, but for landscapes you'd never know. It's got a very good wide angle range for a digital lens. It's a great value, and way better than any junk Sigma puts out.ViewFinder-Some have slammed the viewfinder. It does take a little getting used to, like looking down a long dark corridor at first. But it's just as bright as any AF SLR once you get used to it. I think Nikon designed it this way to get people used to the CCD aspect ratio. It's kind of like watching a DVD in letterbox format. Good news: the viewfinder has a diopter for eyeglass wearers.Picture Quality-This is where the rubber meets the road. At all ISO settings, the images are superb. Colors are saturated and lifelike, with the &quot;Nikon Pop&quot;. They remind me of a good ISO 100 slide film like Kodak E100G, or Fujichrome Velvia 100. Best of all, the grain is very low, even ISO 1600 is not bad when printed to 8 x10. This is a huge advance over my older Canon G2 digital. Like I said, think ISO 100 slide film.This is destined to be one of Nikon's legends, like the N8008, N90, FM2N, etc. You get a lot of value for your money, much more than the Canon Digital Rebel. A lot of pros are buying D70s for backup, and the Press Photographers Association of Japan just picked the D70 as new camera of the year! What else could you ask for? This is a top drawer camera with a great lens."",)"

"('I\'ll try and put this review in for both of Amazon\'s NE300 models, since they are just different colours afterall. Further to what\'s already been said, here is some extra info on the player that I was unable to find elsewhere prior to buying it, so this may be of help:- if an MP3 song lack\'s ID3 tags, the player\'s LCD screen will show the filename as you\'d see it in windows. Long filenames will scroll automatically- manually going from mp3 track to track (ie, just hitting forward) there is around a 3 sec delay. If you let a song finish by itself, however, it will go immediately to the next- load time on a full mp3 disc is 20 seconds (I timed it). Load time on a disc with a single mp3 was 16 seconds. Load time on an audio cd with one track was 10-11 seconds- this player does not play .wma (windows media audio) files, even though the guy at sony I asked said it does (admittedly the player does not advertise that it plays wma)- the cd-rw disc I tried worked fine, and that\'s all I\'ll be using- stock headphones seem decent, and in fact with them this player does go very loud- music order: I had no problems with it. Whether files were in the root directory, or within sub folders everything seemed to play in order as it was burned- adtrack I did not test. I have no intention of converting all of my mp3s, so no idea on how well it works- I experienced no ""missing end pieces"" on songs, as one reviewer said that he did- I\'m confirming that there is no backlight for this- note that the NE300 blue and gray, on amazon, are slightly different pictures. I bought the gray one from another source and it looked as the blue one on amazon does (it was gray, obviously, but the physical shape of it, I mean). The gray on amazon has a little indicator below the LCD (which mine does not have). I wonder if there are slightly different versions, and the newer ones possibly solve some old issues like track order? I bought mine yesterday BTW.- I experienced no skipping issues, but I only tried the player in the car and shaking it for maybe 10 seconds. I think technology is such these days that if you\'re experiencing mp3 skipping on an mp3 discman, it\'s probably a very poor player; I\'d expect no skipping (except maybe running, and supposedly this can handle that)I give this a 5-star, because it does everything that it claims to do, and it does it well. The player feels reasonably solid. It is, afterall, a $50 player with a lot built into it, so don\'t expect something you can use as a frisbee. It\'s quite small with little wasted room.I do wish it had a backlight, and I\'d have no problem losing some battery life (especially since it\'s awesome with this player), but I knew I was not getting that when I bought it.EDIT: I should mention something else. When you\'re scanning from song to song, you will see it exactly as you\'d see it in windows explorer, ie. no ID3 tagging; just the file name. It\'s not until you play the song that you\'ll see the ID3 tag details, like album, artist, etc.',)"
"(""[Follow up: the Sony site is currently listing only 3 models, with the DN340 most likely the pick of the litter because of its top mounted controls and easy read-outs.  Don't be surprised if you end up paying a premium to the current retail Sony price, since these are getting harder and harder to come by. If you find a good deal on a phased-out DN330 or 430, go for it. Sony managed to come up with a sophisticated (overly so), efficient player that will run on a single AA battery--easily outlasting the 2 batteries consumed by a ten-twenty dollar Colby or J-Win.]If you have a good portable CD player, hang on to it. Of the models currently advertised on Amazon as best-sellers--Colby, J-Win, GPX, Emerson--they're at best very temporary solutions, sure to fail in short order, to consume batteries voraciously, to skip and play erratically, to be deficient in volume. Only the Sony DN series is worth considering, even at twice the price of the others (including the more basic, cheaply-made Sony models in the DE, DF, DJ series) and even if you have no interest in ATRAC capabilities or tuner bands. Unfortunately, these features slow down and complicate operation (I still find it quickest to turn off the machine by simply opening and closing the lid). But most importantly, the Sony continues to work when the others fail.  You may wish to look on Amazon for the model in the SONY DN series that operates efficiently on a single AA battery (the 505 requires two batteries).It's clear that manufacturers are no longer attending to CD player technology, but if you're still a fan of the format, this line of Sony players is probably your best (maybe your last) hope. I'm not sure I understand why the ATRAC compression features of the machine would appeal to some users (why not simply pick up an MP3 player?),  but if that's the trade-off for a decent CD player, I'll put up with the gratuitous technology."",)"

"('After using a gps in a rental car, I bought this.  Fairly easy to use but a bit difficult to change guidance when you go left and it thought you would go right, it tries to send you back to its favored way even though you would have to backtrack--most of the time though, directions are very good.  Database good and extensive, although locally it lists a water softener seller under restaurants--hey, it\'s cuz ""water"" is in their company name! (That\'s the downside of extensive, a few errors, but I\'d rather have more choices with some wrong, than to have a limited database, so they made the right choice.) Don\'t get me wrong, this is a fine device, I\'d buy it again as its database is mostly good and is detailed, it is very accurate as to where I am on the road, it shows car speed, it lists addresses and phone numbers of the businesses in its database in case you wanna call--very useful--and it starts up (finds the satellites) pretty quickly.  Biggest complaint--no power source other than ac cord and car lighter adapter--hey Garmin, give us some batteries so we can use this while hiking or walking around a town!Update May 2005.  I took the device to New Mexico for a wedding, and it worked great there, Santa Fe was made simple. Did well in Indianapolis last year when I had a meeting there, as well as a weekend in Chicago this past winter, restaurants and museums and ways into and out of Chicago, Seattle, etc.  A dependable device.  Again, Garmin, give us a power supply so that we can carry this unit with us instead of having to plug into a wall or into a car, and then you\'ll really have a great device!  I have a good intrinsic ""direction sense"" myself such that I am rarely lost wherever I go--London, Athens, Beijing, Vancouver, Amsterdam, Denver, Toronto, New York, Vienna, Tel Aviv, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Dublin, Puerto Rico, Manchester, Hong Kong, Boston, Montreal, Cancun, Berlin, etc. (although I had to adjust for the sun angle in Buenos Aires)--point is, I\'m not ""directionally challenged"", so my leaning on this device for directions and current location is because it works well and I\'m confident in it.',)"
"(""I just bought the Garmin 2620 a few weeks ago and wanted to share my initial impressions.  I'll come back later and update this review when I've given the unit some serious highway time.All in all, my initial experiences have been pretty good.  I've used the unit for several weeks now in a variety of city and occassional highway driving in mostly familiar places.  It will get you to where you're going but you have to watch it closely as it makes some odd calls from time to time.I was a bit shocked when I first saw the unit -- I simply couldn't believe how small it was and couldn't believe the display was big enough to be useful.  A bit of playing with the unit in the car dispelled that notion -- it's big enough when the unit is close to you on the dash and small enough to fit in your coat pocket when you need to transport it.The temporary beanbag mount works pretty well -- it'll stay put in reasonably hard cornering, but in an accident the GPS unit could become a 1 pound bullet loose in your car cabin.  Fortunately more permanent mounts are included.I was a bit disappointed by the age of the maps -- for example, many connecting streets to my home street aren't in the maps although the streets have been there now for about 3 years.  (Yes, I have the very latest maps and firmware, I checked).  Similarly, any areas where there has been construction in the last few years (ramp added, etc) is likely to result in bad directions.The most irritating thing about this unit is its tendency to pin the instructions as to when to turn centered in the middle of the intersection.  This seems reasonable until you realize that it may be off by 400-500 feet if a ramp is required to get you to the middle of the intersection.Earlier today, it told me I had .5 mile to go to a turn but the ramp to the turn was 100' in front of me.  (It was a .5 mile long freeway ramp).  This is annoying -- you really have to pay attention to what it's telling you and reconcile this with the road signs -- sometimes if you blindly follow its instructions you'll miss your turns.  (And it will then have you backtrack -- you won't get lost, but it's annoying).Occassionaly the unit will pick REALLY ODD ways of traversing roads to get you to your destinations.  Twice now it's picked wild circular routes to get me to a certain street when that street is easily accessible in a much more direct fashion.If you really want to see how accurate this unit is, stick to familiar areas and deliberately drive off course and see what suggestions it makes.  Last week when I was on a northbound feeder road (a parallel road to the highway), it told me to take a left turn onto a street accessible only from the southbound feeder road.  This would have required jumping the car over the highway to make the turn.  Speed Racer would be proud of that move.  :)I've been focusing on the negative aspects of the unit -- there are many positive aspects.  It WILL get you to your destination.  The touch screen is very nice and very readable in direct sun or at night (and everything between).  The fact that there are no maps that need to be unlocked is wonderful.  The unit is fairly easy to use although mastering it will take a bit of practice and a pass or two through the users guide.Initial impressions -- this thing works and is a lot of fun but it's not perfect.  It consistently gets high praise in the magazines and by customers and at a pricepoint in the low 800's (after rebate), it seems like a pretty reasonable deal.1/27/05 update -- I've had the 2620 for several months now and have taken it on several long highway trips, as well as used it to navigate deep into a big city.  I'm still quite satisfied.  It's a blast to have this on long highway trips -- it is enormously cool to watch yourself move across a state map in real time.  As mentioned before, this unit will occassionaly pick some weird routes to destinations, but it will get you there and it's enormously fun to have.  I was thinking I'd need to quickly get an external antenna, but have never had the need as it has never lost its satellite signal (except for when I was delayed by traffic under an overpass).Buy it -- you'll like it.  Shop around for price -- there are enormous price variations on this unit!  (I bought mine for about $500 under what Best Buy was selling the unit for)."",)"

"(""...this thing has worked for me from the beginning, with no hitches.  All software installs, including Sonic Stage updates, have gone smoothly.  For just ripping CDs onto the MD unit, Simple Burner works perfectly and quickly.  Sonic Stage is a little clunky, but it hasn't failed on me yet.  USB transfers have been seamless and fast.The rechargable battery life is excellent for just playing music, and if you know you're going to be using it a lot on a road trip, just bring a spare AA or two and you'll be good to go for a lonnng time.  I find the screw-on battery gives much greater flexibility.  It adds about 3/4 of an inch to the length of the NH900 when it is attached.Live concert recordings made with binaural stereo microphones are just amazing.  Just don't use the automatic gain control (AGC), and DO set the mic sensitivity and recording levels according to what kind of mics you use and what kind of music you are recording.The newly-released Sony wave converter utility improves upon the Hi-MD's overall usefulness by allowing you to convert material recorded on the MD unit into wave files for editing, CD burning, etc.  It works perfectly.Some improvements I would make if I were King:1.  The NH900 unit's display should most definitely have a backlight, as it is awkward to read under anything but ideal lighting conditions without turning it to get the best view.2.  The headphones Sony ships with this should be much better.  They are just plain uncomfortable.  They do, however, have a shortened cable which makes them better for use with the remote.  I use Sennheiser PX-100's with mine.3.  Navigating the menus, both on the MD and on the remote, takes a little practice, mostly because of the very small display (i.e. one line on the remote).4.  Speaking of the remote, this one is nice and sleek and works well enough, but there is another one Sony sells overseas, the model RM-MC40ELK (Google that and you'll find it at several online sources for about $80) that has a larger, 3-line backlit display."",)"
"('Adequate.I\'ve owned four of the Sony WM-FX290 series over the years. I use them primarily for audio-books - and I listen to thirty/forty books a year which easily means hundreds of hours of use. I\'m mostly satisfied with the model, taking into account price, durability, ease of use, quality of sound, etc. There are significantly more expense cassette players (as well as really inexpensive, rather breakable models)but overall, this model is about as good as I\'ve seen for the price. I\'m not particularly thrilled about it mostly because I can remember sturdier models with more features and better design (at the same price) but, alas, they\'re no longer made.Good points: Moderately priced, decent sound, great battery life (1 rechargeable lasts 4-6 hours cassette playing), easy-to-program radioBad points: Opaque-cover (you can\'t just look & see how much tape is left without taking tape out), no auto-reverse, battery ""holder"" easily broken (from a six inch drop)requiring tape to keep battery in place, no ""clip"" to attach to pants, too sensitive too squeezing (when I jog or walk, I hold the Walkman in my hand or pocket squeezing the player and slooowing the playback). Further, after several months of opening/closing, the tape holder doesn\'t seem to keep the cassettes in alignment making them again slow down (and making me adjust the tapes to just the right spot).Despite all this, I\'d recommend the player mainly because of the price. While I remember 10 years ago, we could\'ve gotten auto-reverse, translucent views of the cassette, a molded rubber exterior, a convenient/unobtrusive clip, etc. from Sony, but they no longer bother with them at this price. I remember they also had the ability to rewind a tape while listening to the radio: not possible now.(I\'ve owned 4 over the 6 years: two I dropped (from less than a foot and once on a carpet) after several months and damaged the battery spring holder; eventually taping them didn\'t work, one just grew too old after fifty audiobooks (at least 400 hours use), and the fourth one\'s sound gradually faded away after a year.',)"
"('I go on vacations with my family all the time and we drive everywhere. So I am always looking for fun ways to pass the time while sitting in the car for long road trips. And Toshiba sd-p1400 player is now my NEW BEST FRIEND! Nothing passes the time better than to watch a two-hour movie or enjoy a ""tv on dvd"" marathon of my favorite show.RESEARCH:I spent several hours, weeks even, reading reviews of several dvd players and comparing costs before I pick this one. If you are doing the same, I definetly recommend not paying over $200 for a portable player, stick with name brands, and not getting one with a screen bigger than 7 inch. 7 inch is big enough so that you feel perfectly comfortable watching it and not so big that for the cost and size--you might have as well brought along a laptop.IMPORTANT THINGS LEARNED FROM ACTUAL USAGEI bought this player before a thanksgiving trip in nov. 2004 and been very happy with it since.ONE (POWERING THE PLAYER FOR LONG USE):Personally, I am not concern with the battery life, as I use the car power adapter the whole time during road trips and the power cord when in hotels. I do sit in the back seat of a huge suburban, and no the car power adapter cord that comes with the player was not long enough, but I bought a $10 car adapter extension cord and it solve the problem like a charm! Just hook the extension and the toshiba car adapters together for plenty of cord length for just about any car or truck.TWO (PICTURE & SOUND QUALITY):Picture quality is very nice. Sharp and clear. But as with any LCD screen, including laptops, dark scenes will be dark but not to a horrible point, and more than two people will have trouble watching it--as LCD screens from far away or too far from the side look very dark.The sound is very good for a portable player but I would recommend tht for best sound, you do have to wear headphones and set the audio on the player to 3D surround headphone mode. I never really like listening to it through the speakers on the player. It has two headphone slots and if needed for maybe a third person, again buy a cheap $3 headphone splitter (lets you hook two headphones in the same spot). Overall, I watch tv shows like the Sopranos, the Simpsons, and movies like Finding Nemo and Pirates of the Caribbean very comfortably.THREE (USE IN A HOTEL OR HOUSE):Most hotels don\'t allow things to be hookup to the tv but for families, that go to condos, or in my experience, Marriott Vacation villas, this player is super easy to hook-up to tvs. I have so far only use the av cable for hook-up but s-video cable is also available with this player too. It is very convient to have this player to watch dvd rentals or movies you brought, as sometimes, even expensive vacation houses will ""gip"" you out of a dvd player for the tv or it is convient just to have an extra one for watching movies in other rooms.AS FOR HOME, this player is my best friend on vacations, but when it comes to home, I don\'t use it. Portable dvd players are small and the inside internals that make it work are very small and might burn out with over-use. So I would not recommend putting a portable player under the strenuous use of home viewing (watching movies or ""tv on dvd"" just about every day or week, all year long), as regular dvd player units are as cheap as $30 -$60 dollars now and so they would be less costly to replace and will hold up to home use better anyway.Overall, for a couple hours use - every one or two week vacation or so, this portable player works GREAT.WELL, obviously, I like this player. It has lots of other features that I havent even mention, like you can watch \'burn\' movies on it (dvd-r) and listen to cds (regular and mp3s) on it too, and more. DEFINETLY AN AWESOME player for the price and to have fun portable viewing on the road.',)"
"('I bought these earbuds as a replacement for the weak-sounding OEM Apple earbuds that came with the 60gb video iPod I purchased in the summer of 2006.  The OEM earbud wire actually broke physically (I like to wrap the headphone wire vertically around the iPod, with the plug in the jack, when I\'m not using it) and I decided to upgrade to an aftermarket pair both for physical durability and enhanced sonic quality.  Let\'s be clear from the start: If you\'re listening to music on an iPod, we\'re NOT talking Hi-Fi to begin with, which I\'m sure all you audiophiles out there already know but I just want to clarify this from the outset.  That said, for the quality of reproduction you should expect from an iPod, you don\'t want your earphones to detract even further!I recorded just about all (more than 95%) of my music into iTunes from my CD collection rather than buying it online from the iTunes store.  Mostly I listen to rock, but also classical, jazz, opera and country, and I keep my iPod equalizer setting on ""Rock"" almost all the time.  I reviewed all of the earbuds in this review on that setting.  Usually I listen sitting on a train on my 2-hour commute to and from work weekdays.  Also, I purchased all of these at the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, which is a pretty cool place to go in and join the ""buzz"" [and which I have no affiliation with].Apple OEM earbuds: I purchased these with the iPod in July 2006, replacement price $29 from Apple\'s website; Sound quality: 4 out of 10 [with 0 being ""does not reproduce sound"" and 10 being the ""best"" I think one could expect from earbuds with an iPod] -- poor bass response in real-life.  In-ear fit: 4 out of 10 -- hard plastic discs stay in the outer ear canal generally but are not ""snug"", this lack of direct ear canal pressure detracts from lower-frequency reproduction ability.  Durability: 3 out of 10 -- OK, maybe I shouldn\'t wrap the wire around the iPod, but I do... the stress that induced on the main wire at the jack caused the wire to break off after 5 months.Senheisser Style OMX 90 earbuds:  I purchased these in December 2006 for $89.95; sound quality: 5 out of 10 -- part of the reason I bought these is they were the only pair I could find with performance specifications listed on or in the package, I think they were claiming 19Hz-22kHz and 115dB, which looks pretty darn good on paper.  Unfortunately, these, like the Apple OEM buds, are not snug in the ear canal so suffer from poor low-frequency response in real-life.  In-ear fit: 2 out of 10 -- Jeez these looked cool, with their over-ear ""eyeglasses"" style clips I thought they\'d be great, like the B&O; A8s which I\'d never tried but look so cool and cost twice as much and after all,  they ARE Sennheisers, which I\'ve had real cans by for my home stereo for decades and sound great... but when I actually used them they basically hung on my ears and flopped around in my ear canals more than the Apple OEM buds ever did.  Durability:  I can\'t really say because after a week I replaced them with the Bose Triports.  These were the only buds with a volume control built in to the wire; I guess I liked this but in retrospect it just seems like a marketing gimmick -- I can just as easily adjust the volume on the iPod, so why bother with additional hardware (and weight) on my wires?Bose Triport in-ear Headphones: I purchased these in December 2006 for $99.95; sound quality: 7 out of 10 -- I bought these to replace the Sennheisers and they were a HUGE improvement mainly (as far as I can tell) because of the anatomically-molded silicone ear canal inserts.  These provide a snug in-ear fit which leads to vastly improved frequency response across the spectrum but most noticably in the bass frequencies.  Unfortunately the bass response is actually muddy!  I could improve this somewhat by switching from ""Rock"" to ""Bass Reducer"" on my iPod equalizer settings, but even so these always sounded muddy to me in the low frequencies... that said, MUCH better overall than the Apples and the Sennheisers. In-ear fit: 9 out of 10 -- these are fantastic, with 3 pairs of silicone inserts, large medium and small, should fit 99% of all listeners better than just about anything else available.  Durability: 5 out of 10 -- Unfortunately, the wonderful silicone inserts do not stay attached to the plastic earbuds so I\'d recommend if you like these that you purchase a case of the size you like; if you\'re like me, you\'ll lose a pair a month, on average.Sure E3C-N (black) Headphones: I purchased these in April 2007 for $179.95, to replace the Bose Triports; this is a bit unfair since on a dollar basis I should be reviewing the Sure E2Cs,  which cost $99.95 (similar to my other aftermarket buds), but in the end I decided perhaps you get what you pay for with earbuds and decided to double my budget for this set.  Sound quality: 9 out of 10 -- much more even frequency distribution than the others, and smooth bass response unlike the Bose Triports.  Also these are more efficient than any of the others, with iPod volume settings around 50% giving similar dBs in my ear as when I used the Triports on 85% and the Sennheisers on 100%.  Crisp, clear sound all the way up to 100% on my iPod volume settings.  In-ear fit: 7 out of 10 -- These buds come with a variety of size and composition inserts -- I use the small silicone symmetric hemispherical buds, which fit best for me, though they are less perfect than the ergonomic silicone inserts that come with the Triports. If you don\'t select the right size for your ear canal, the Sure inserts can begin to work loose (not as bad as the OEM Apples or the shaky Sennheisers) if you start to, say, walk; or chew.  This is fairly irritating since when they\'re snug in-ear they sound really great (and you should insert them pretty far into your ear canal, pulling back on the ear as you insert them).  Durability: I\'ve only had them about a month, so hard to say, but the rubber inserts don\'t fall off the plastic part of the buds easily the way the Triports suffer; also the wires are about twice the diameter of the others in this review (which might also account for some of the better sonic efficiency), so I expect them to last longer physically than any of the others.',)"
"(""I bought this little projector mostly to attend on-line classes with, and to have a way to play games when my brain was full (which is very often;)). I also wanted a way to watch TV without having a big & ugly TV in my home office. A projector seemed the best solution, so I gave it a go.The Epson has generous connectivity options, which allowed me to hook it up to numerous video sources simultaneously, and then switch between them all (yeah!). I have it as S-Video from my cable system's DVD R/W recorder, computer / component video from my main computer, and the 3-RCA video/audio (composite) connectors from my x-box.In fact, the Epson sits right on top of my x-box, making for a highly cool, highly compact gaming unit with awesome capability. It takes a few minutes to transition from gaming in a fishbowl to playing in a life-size environment & getting accustomed to so much motion. Screen is plenty bright, though some of the darker interior scenes from the likes of Halo-1 are best played with the lights down (my screen is about 6 X 8 feet, 1.83 X 2.44m).The device has fittings for ceiling mounts, but I'm more inclined to the portability of the included carrying case, if anything.Switching between the video channels is either by hand-held remote or via the little control panel situated on top of the Epson. There is a second remote that is for operating your computer's mouse for presentations, including page up/down & L/R clicking, and it works great on xp pro with the included IR (InfraRed) USB receiver. Sounds complicated but installation was all of plugging the little IR cable/module into a USB port & then playing with the neat-o mouse remote. This is great for remotely fast-forwarding through commercials when playing DVDs through a computer. The projector has IR receivers fore and aft, BTW.The main remote controls the video input selection, speaker volume (including mute), on-screen menu (very easy to use, with lots of selections for picky people), freeze video, a handy one-button color mode (Theater, Presentation, etc), Aspect ratio (2 settings), and ZOOM.Video quality largely depends on the type of video input you apply to the Epson, with composite at the low end, s-video in the middle, and computer / component as highest picture clarity. The differences between these input types are about an order of magnitude, everything else being equal. By all means opt for computer / component input! Its like night and day as far as video quality goes.Presentation fonts come through crystal clear, as do digital images, and watching a cable program or DVD on the unit is great fun (especially through the computer / component video port, where the picture is crystal clear). Although not what you would build a breathtaking home theater system around the Epson is nevertheless a practical, fun, truly plug & play projector that will connect to just about anything and go.5-stars, among the entry-level projectors."",)"

"(""This is my second pair, and these are smoking deal in my opinion.  I used them in a very unconventional way, however.  I have an old Jeep Wrangler which, from October-April in Arizona, has no top.  I needed speakers that were all of the following without sacrificing audio quality:  inexpensive, compact, weather resistant, rugged, easy to install, yet hard to steal. I'll start with the speakers themselves and then comment on price.1. Compact:  I welded the brackets for these speakers onto the rear of my roll cage.  I needed something that would be small enough that it wouldn't interfere with the rear passenger's head or shoulder room.  Mission accomplished.2. Weather Resistant / rugged:  So far -- mud, rain, a fair amount of hard core off roading & rock crawling, days in the sun with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees (yes, in October), and a few nights with temperatures below 40 degrees.  The composite enclosure and weather resistant drivers have held up quite well.  No cosmetic damage at all, other than being dirty, and no reduction in sound quality.  I'm impressed.3. Easy to install yet hard to steal:  Well, I welded the handy brackets to my roll cage, so those aren't coming off (see side bar at end of the review).  That part took me 20 minutes to do including grinding the paint off the brackets and the roll cage itself in the appropriate locations.  Then you use a couple of provided screw knobs to attach the speakers to the brackets.  Theoretically, a thief could just unscrew those knobs and remove the speakers, so I used a little thread locker red, which makes it really difficult to back the knobs out.  Difficult enough that a thief will probably give up before they actually get the knobs to turn.  I think I'm good.4. Audio quality:  Just because this is #4 on this list doesn't mean it's a low priority.  In fact this and price are why I first considered Yamaha.  These are good quality, good sounding speakers with a nice full frequency response in open areas.  The stereo imaging is good, and they actually have a little MORE bass than I expected out of such a small speaker, especially when you consider that I have them installed in a totally open space (no wall or corner behind them to reinforce the bass frequencies).  I'm pleased.  Of note, these are 6 ohm speakers.  This was another reason I chose them OVER some other reputable all weather speaker brands.  Car stereos rate their power output at 4 ohms, and most speakers intended for use in or around the home are 8 ohm speakers.  A car stereo driving a pair of 8 ohm speakers would output approximately half the wattage as it would when powering 4 ohm speakers, which would limit volume.  At 6 ohms, the stereo in my Jeep drives these Yamahas loud enough that I can clearly hear the music at highway speeds, without distorting them.  Plus, I could still use them for home audio if I chose to do so.  Very versatile.5. Price:  Yamaha is a very reputable brand name. In my experience, they make good reliable speakers.  This holds true for the AW150.  Based on all of the above, at a price point that is half or better than many competitors such as Polk, Bose, etc.., you cannot go wrong with these little Yamahas.  Highly recommend.*Side bar:  This is my second pair of AW150s.  I welded the first pair in my Jeep several months ago.  On a recent four wheeling trip, the beating caused the welds to fail on one of the speaker brackets (this was my first time trying to weld something), and the speaker bracket broke off the roll bar.  While on the highway driving home, the speaker bounced out of the vehicle at about 70 MPH and was lost and gone forever.  Hence, pair #2.Happy listening!"",)"

"('I made the mistake of waiting until after I had asked for and received the Griffin RadioSHARK (to use the official orthography) as a gift before reading some of the reviews on this page. And so I was worried that I had wasted someone else\'s money on a substandard piece of equipment. I am pleased to say that so far, that hasn\'t been the case at all. With one minor exception, I am very happy with how the RadioSHARK has performed.Some reviewers have complained about poor reception or interference from other computer equipment, but that has not been an issue for me. Even when the RadioSHARK was sitting right next to the monitor, interference with AM reception was minimal. Now that it\'s sitting on a window sill a few feet away from the screen and CPU, reception is just fine. In fact, the RadioSHARK\'s reception is better than that of the stereo system in the same room, although the stereo has its own powered external antenna sitting on the same window sill.The one thing that disappointed me was that the feature I found most interesting when I first read about the RadioSHARK -- the automatic synchronization with iTunes -- turns out to be functional for Macs only. For PC users like me, RadioSHARK saves broadcasts in .WAV or .WMA formats with no direct importing to iTunes. This is something to be aware of. A test recording of an hour-long broadcast of ""Car Talk"" weighed in at a hefty 41.5mb on my hard drive, about twice the size of similar-length files saved as .MP3s. However, when I imported that file into iTunes, that program automatically converted it to .AAC format and it works fine on my iPod. It\'s not as smooth and easy as having it all done automatically like on a Mac, but the two or three extra steps aren\'t crippling. I will be sure to delete old broadcasts when I\'m done with them, since it looks like they have the potential to fill up my hard drive pretty quickly.(The manual teases that for PC users, ""currently, only WAV is available"" as a file format. Perhaps later upgrades to the RadioSHARK will change that?)I had another concern too, but it seems to have been resolved with the latest iteration of the RadioSHARK software. Moral: keep checking the manufacturer\'s site, since they continue to upgrade the program.On the whole, the RadioSHARK seems to be performing as a very good desktop AM/FM radio and an excellent way to enjoy radio shows when I want to on my iPod. I believe that it has rendered that stereo I mentioned more or less redundant in that particular room -- thus freeing up another shelf or two in my bookcase! Bonus benefit for a tool that so far, I\'m quite happy with.',)"

"('I purchased the 4960 to replace a broken Toshiba SD-4700. What a disappointment! This unit is a huge step back from the 4700.The PICTURE IS SO BAD, that I could not believe my eyes. I have a 55"" HDTV, 3:4, made by Toshiba (don\'t they test their players on their TVs?) I am using the component inputs in progressive mode. What is so bad with the picture: Everything. First, it is not sharp enough, actually, this is an understatement. Second, the colors are washed away, grayish, dull. Out of the box, it is too bright. I tried all corrections possible on my TV, boosted the contrast (not that I am a big fan of high contrast), lowered the brightness, the picture was still bad. I am not too picky about the video and I am more concerned with the sound quality but this unit makes you want to throw your TV away. Nothing changes if I switch to interlaced mode.The AUDIO section is excellent. There are some reports that the DACs are Blurr-Brown. I did not open it to verify this but they certainly sound like this. Very smooth, yet detailed, perhaps not as much as other high quality DACs but very listenable. The bass is somewhat soft and some may find the highs a bit muted but I am really being too picky here. It pushes the limits of my system (Marantz SR-7000 receiver, Definitive Technology BP-10 speakers).  People with better equipment would not consider this player as a CD player anyway. The DVD-audio is excellent, too but not as satisfying as 2 channel DVD-audio that really shines. It is noticeably better that the DVD-audio on the SD-4700. I cannot say much about the SACD play - I own only one title - The Dark Side of the Moon, and it does not sound as good as I expected. The bass is a bit boomy, the sound is somewhat dark. Well, it is a 30+ years old recording. I read somewhere that the SACD is processed by a different DAC made by Phillips.A big annoyance is that the LFE levels on DVD-audio and 2 channel stereo/SACD are very different - about 15 dB or more. The player does not have the ability to adjust the LFE or any other channel level. The bass management redirects the bass from the L, R, etc. speakers to the sub, if needed. It seems to work on DD, (on DVD-Audio maybe) but not on 2 channel stereo.The REMOTE is terrible, the unit responds very slowly to it, sometimes never does, many controls are unintuitive. For example, the play button sometimes has to be pressed once, shortly, as usual but sometimes you need to hold it for a second or so if there is a menu on the screen (pressing it for a short time acts as an OK button). The problem is that when listening to CDs you do not watch the TV screen and never know whether Stop, Pause, Play buttons have to be hold or not. Most of the time, you have to hold them. Very annoying. The telephone rings, you press Pause, nothing happens. Then you remember that you have to press and hold. Meanwhile, the phone stops ringing. Another annoying thing is that the OK button is not in the center of the Up, Down, Left, Right ones.I decided to keep this player as a universal music player and to look for another one for movies. I had to hook it up through the S-video inputs in order to free the component ones for another player. Then the big surprise came. The picture through the S-video inputs was excellent! If I did not know that it was coming from the S-video input, I would be very happy with my purchase. It was much sharper than before, better colors, better everything. I tried the composite input - still very good picture with visible loss of detail as can be expected.A nice surprise is the pan-scan feature - it really works. It zooms anamorphic wide-screen movies so that they fit perfectly on a 4:3 screen with loss of some information on the sides, of course. The pan-scan on the 4700 never made any difference.It does not play my DVD+R\'s. Actually, it does but the motion is very jittery. Toshiba said that they do not support DVD+R because they are in the DVD-R camp. Makes you feel happy.I managed to fix the old SD-4700 and hooked it up again. The difference is striking - the SD-4700 has a way better picture than the 4960. They both use Zoran chips of different generations, I guess, so I cannot understand what went wrong with the 4960. I also tried Harman Kardon DVD-22 (excellent video but it has other problems) . The 4700 comes close after it, while the 4960 does not compare to those two at all, it is just terrible.1 star for video, 5 for audio. Since this is a DVD player after all, my overall rating is 2 stars. One more than it really deserves because people with non HD TVs might be actually satisfied. It is a good value however, for the sound.Update:After 6-7 months, the player refused to play DVD-Audio. Toshiba replaced it with a new unit. Meanwhile, I discovered that the bass management is completely messed up. In SACD mode, it would not output any bass to the sub, if  some speakers are set to large, others to small. If all are set to small, the bass is too strong and boomy. If all are set to large, the bass  form the .1 channel is about 20 dB or so weaker than normal. This makes me believe that in ""small"" mode, the .1 channel is practically lost because the bass from the other channels dominates it.',)"

"('I use this router on our main network of about 40 permanent users and another 20 or so users (clients) that come and go. At any one time it is negotiating 50 to 65 users via DHCP through four 24 port managed switches about ten 4 to 8 port hubs and six WAP\'s. Clients come and go everyday, some with Mac\'s others with PC\'s and I never have to do anything to get them on the internet. In the two years it has been in service I think that I rebooted it once and I\'m not positive that it was the problem since I will reboot the modem, switches and router together. Occasionally things do get turned off for maintenance, but looking at the router admin page right now it has been running 54 days straight. I have to say it is much more stable than other small routers that advertise delivering 99 DHCP address\'s but really can only deliver about 10 without having to use static IP\'s. It\'s powerful browser interface lets you manage port bandwidth, port function and port priority easily. Some departments need more or less speed or higher priority. Security notifications via email keep me on top of potential attacks. The effect on speed due to security features was negligible. The ""Block WAN request"" even keeps our own ISP from seeing us. All these things are simple to setup. As a basic router it is very powerful.The only short coming that I see is with the load balancing. This seems to really slow the speed significantly. I think that it is just too much for the CPU to handle. My intention was to have two different ISP\'s for redundancy. As a fix I leave both providers connected but only activate one WAN port at a time. If one WAN goes down I can quickly activate the other WAN port without anyone really being affected. The other ISP is mainly used for FTP anyway.On the problems with VPN\'s, we don\'t use them so I can\'t comment on that.In closing, you could spend thousands to get some of the features that facilitate subnets and load balancing, for the price it works very well.Update: I have since purchased a second RV016 (firmware 2.0.13) with the same solid performance. I\'ve read about some of the problems that others are having and would say that compatibility with other vendors is an issue to consider. Also using switches versus hubs takes some of the load off the routers CPU.Update 2: We now own three routers without problem. I know that some have complained about customer service and I have to agree it\'s lacking. But what I would tell less experienced users is that the Sitemap column on the right side of the browser interface has extensive explanations of all the settings. This combined with a little experimentation should get you where you need to be. The file sharing problems that another reviewer had has nothing to do with the router, it\'s all about the computer settings. Another reviewer commented on customer service asking about the color of the cables. In the early days of DSL and daisy chaining hubs, crossover cables were used and they were generally orange or yellow and will not work with most equipment.',)"
"(""I have had mine for about a year now, and it still works, which is more than one can say of the cheapy DVD players. But it does not work perfectly.The first one I got had a bad habit of turning off erratically when I pressed the play button on the remote after certain other key combinations. I called customer service, and they were completely baffled. So I returned it and got another one, which did the same thing, but at least a less often. So I kept it.The remote is small and the keys, while slightly different in shape for different functions, are lined up in neat rows and columns, and are difficult to memorize. The keys perform significantly different functions in different modes, such as DVD vs JPEG. And once you go into zoom, you lose some key functions entirely, such as slow motion. The zoom is useful for watching letter box movies, so this is not good.Sound from the CD function is disappointingly mediocre, not good enough for feeding into my sound system.As to playing everything you can throw at it, this is an overstatement. First of all it does not play any Windows Media. And I have tried some compressed movie disks and it had trouble.Another irritant is that it lacks most basic control buttons on the player, itself; you have to use the remote for almost everything. Is it asking too much to be able to skip chapters or music tracks from the player?One plus is that it has a resume function for the last five dvds. Just press play shortly after inserting the disc and it will start up where you left off.It also has JPGs arranged by directory, similar to an old DOS graphic user interface on a computer, and is reasonably easy to navigate.The original claim to fame of the DVP642 was that it did not have macrovision on the video output, so you could connect it through your vhs and into the tv through the rf out. You could also copy to vhs. This of course is illegal. And reports are the new ones don't have this.The other key asset is DIVX. But i have yet to figure out how to make divx discs.I would assume there are better deals out there these days.But otherwise, it is good, with a good picture."",)"
"('I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon.  It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections.  the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud.',)"
"('First of all, let me say that this unit is very well worth the money. As ""just a dvd player"" I give it FIVE over FIVE points (or ten/ten if you wish).The unit comes locked for Region 1 DVDs, but can be easily unlocked (just google for the asnwer) to make it region-free. I have tested my unit purchased on amazon.com and unlocked with Region 1, region 2 dvds purchased from Britain, and region 4 DVDs purchased in South America. It just works.The unit\'s COMPONENT-VIDEO output is superb, even if you use an CRT TV. I recommend you get a quality component video cable and use that instead of the ""composite video"" output.When playing MPG and AVI files, the component video output shows pixelation and artifacts on low-quality or low-resolution avi/divx/mpg files, but when playing back the same files and switching the tv to component video, these problems go away!.Component video, it should be noted, is superior to ""s-video"" (which just separates color information from luminance), as each basic color (Red-Green-Blue) travels on a separate shielded cable.Now, the ""extras"" besides basic DVD playback1. DIVX and XVID are supported. But some .avi files will play back with NO SOUND if the original file was encoded with a ""codec"" (compression algorithm) that is not supported by this unit. Just because a file plays back ok on your PC with ""Windows Media Player"" it doesn\'t mean it will playback in this unit.2. DVD-R media *IS* supported. You might need, however, to update the firmware (it\'s available for download from the philips.com web site. You have to download a .iso image, burn the data to a cd-r, press a key combination on the remote and then insert the cd-r disc).Now the problems:1. Even while DivX is supported, mpeg4/divx files compressed with the Divx Pro software using the ""QPEL"" (advanced motion optimization and prediction) will NOT PLAY on the unit. The unit will display an ugly ""QPEL CODEC NOT SUPPORTED"" message and stop there. There\'s no way to play back QPEL encoded files on this unit (it would require a much faster processor inside).2. ZOOM LEVELS ARE INCONSISTENT. On DVD movies, zoom levels featured are 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x. However when you are playing back "".avi"" (mpeg4/divx) files, you will find that often the only zoom levels available are ""normal"" (no zoom) and ""2x"", and that\'s it!.  There is no 1.5x zoom level when paying back mpg and divx files! So forget about watching that wide-screen (4:3 format) movie in full screen by switching to 1.5x zoom mode. If it\'s a DVD movie you can. But if it\'s a DivX/MPEG4 movie you can\'t!.3. A-B loop doesn\'t work most of the time on DivX/AVI files. Sometimes, when it does work, after you selct an a-b loop, you turn the feature off by pressing the a-b key once again, and when you want to create another a-b loop, the feature no longer works! (unless you press STOP and PLAY the file once again). VERY annoying.4. PHILIPS doesn\'t seem very interested in updating the firmware. The last update is dated May 2004, and there has been no update since then, even while the number of bugs is high (see above).However, even after all this, I think that for ~$70 dollars or less including Amazon.com\'s free ground shipping, you can\'t go wrong with this unit, as DVD playback is superb, and the ability to play most (but not all!) .mpg / .avi (DivX/MPEG4/Xvid) video files is just a nice extra to have in there as a ""bonus"".Burning .avi and mpg files to DVD recordable media also works.',)"

"(""A lot of the other reviewers have focused on the technical aspect on this dvd player.  I personally don't have much technical experience (I never bothered educating myself on the different outputs or even what progressive scan meant) so this review isn't going to focus on those elements.  All I can really discuss are the more obvious aspects of simple play and appearance.Appearance wise, this dvd player is quite attractive, setup was a snap, region coding wasn't an issue, and it played my divx recordings just fine.  It has a very slim appearance and a conveniently sized display screen.  When inactive, it even has a screensaver option.  Not the colorful butterflies of some models, but I doubt anyone would let that be a deciding factor against it.  The remote is small yet functional, but I didn't like how hard some of the buttons had to be depressed in order to activate.  While this feature might be a good thing for those with children (who tend to slightly manhandle most buttons) I found it very inconvenient during late nights as I blearily tried switching it off.Performance wise, my biggest complaint was that it made way too much noise.  I bought this to replace my whisper quiet Panasonic (which fell victim to the infamous H02 Error) so this really started to get irritating fast.  Everytime it played, I would hear the disc spinning throughout the movie.  Also, the forward and backward search (helpful for skipping through the numerous intros on boxed sets) were impossibly slow and jumped rather than played through those scenes.  Which meant that you had to not only shuffle through disjointed images that looked more like a slideshow, but you could never pinpoint the location of where you wanted to stop.  As soon as you hit the stop button, or smash as it was in my case since the keys were so darn unresponsive, you'd never end up where you wanted to.  The result being that I've now memorized the theme songs to several of my favorite t.v. shows.  And don't dare try playing around with controls while watching, either.  I found that if I used the search or pause button more than a couple of times during the film, it would often simply shut off...so no easter egg hunts recommended.  Then comes the cherry on top:  it broke.  I've had it for a little over one year and it broke yesterday. Good grief."",)"

"(""In this age of smartphones and MP3 players, I had almost entirely forgotten the simple pleasure of listening to a small, mono, transistor radio while enjoying some suds in the back yard or working on a small project on my garage workbench.  Maybe I've just come to a point in my life when I can appreciate something less than surround-sound and high-fidelity.  This, my friends, is simply a terrific - let me say that again - TERRIFIC little radio.  Keeping in mind that this is a small, inexpensive, and very, very basic transistor radio with one small speaker:Reception:  Has proven to be outstanding.  Sensitivity is high and I can receive remote stations in a canyon setting that my car audio has trouble picking up.  No digital here, folks, this baby is pure analog:  With only an old-school linear display depicting the frequency, you've got to dial in the stations yourself with the tuning dial and judicious directional placement of the antenna.  (or of the device itself, as FM comes in through the metal aerial but AM tunes through a directional ferrite metal rod inside the radio)  Tuning in a weak signal, therefore, requires a good ear and certain finesse of the finger.  For the size and power of the unit, however, reception is excellent.Sound:  Is adequate for a device sporting two AA batteries and one small speaker.  Well, let me say this:  It is more than adequate in a small space like a garage, or when in close proximity as outside in the back yard, or even outside at a distance if you crank the volume and it doesn't have to compete with a lot of background noise.  The speaker is small and low power, however, and this will never be able to compete with a lot of background noise.  Passing jet planes, leaf blowers, or the cabinet saw in your garage will cancel this little guy out.  But then, so would it also just about any other radio you might be listening to.  Basically, the sound is well-matched to the device and I doubt anyone would find it unsatisfactory.Pricing:  Totally reasonable at around 12 to 15 bucks, but a veritable steal if it sinks to single digits.  Considering size, weight, portability, reliability, and downright enjoyment of this radio, the bang to buck ratio is huge.  Huge.Battery life:  Is incredible.  So much so, that I have abandoned all my hand-crank emergency radios in favor of a couple of these.  A single set of good quality AA batteries has lasted me months.  Use has been occasional, but certainly for hours at a time and often for days at a time.  And they are still going.  So, why would I want a cheap hand-crank radio of dubious quality for emergencies when I could have an outstanding little transistor radio of excellent quality which could run for days and days on a single set of batteries?  Right, I wouldn't.  Besides, I can't be the only one out there envisioning that teeny, flimsy plastic crank snapping off just when you're trying to receive critical emergency info.  High quality alkaline batteries are the ticket for this radio, but in my opinion the best way to go are these:Sanyo Eneloop 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesOnce charged, they stay charged for a long time and they last a looooong time in small electronic devices like this.  Charge up a half-dozen to keep on hand for emergencies and back up.Other thoughts:  This radio does not come with a cord to plug into the wall, but then it doesn't need one.  it does have a small jack for headphones (mini jack) if you are so inclined.  Use is really, really easy:  Pull up the antenna, turn the dial on the side for on/off function and volume, use the other dial for tuning, and adjust antenna and dials to suit your experience.  The unit is small - No, not ipod small - about the size and weight of a man's moderately-stuffed wallet.  You know, the kind that makes your back ache if you are sitting on it for an hour's commute.  It's a handsome little unit, too:  Just what one might imagine a small Sony transistor radio would look like.  Simple.  Clean.  Sharp.Lastly, the experience.  Yes, it's a great companion sitting on your workbench as you sharpen your tools or fix your child's toy.  Certainly, it can be a lifesaver during an emergency when the power goes out and you really, truly need to know if you should get out of town.  Absolutely, it is a great thing to have in your truck's console storage for whatever:  desert camping; working that desolate jobsite on a weekend...  But, the best - just positively the very, very best - place to have this radio is with you in the back yard.  With a beer in your hand on a summer afternoon.  Listening to a baseball game under a shade tree.  Folks, if that doesn't transport you to another place then I don't know what will.One last thought.  Do you really need this with all the internet and cable and ipods laying around?  I've got all that, and more MP3 players than I care to count and I say unequivocally yes, you do need this radio.  Because when every other device and situation around you isn't, you will appreciate something that is simple, uncomplicated, and reliable.  Aside from all its other attributes, these qualities alone make it worthwhile.Five stars."",)"
"('good clean style-for under 15 bucks, it is  a lot like the sony I bought as a kid..and nice and compact with good sound on AM and FM.',)"
"(""I'm honestly astonished that this thing has such great reviews despite the huge annoyances it comes with for everyday use. It certainly doesn't help that I bought this radio solely for listening to with headphones as most of the issues are related to that.  The loudspeaker is acceptable, though much poorer quality than my $20 alarm clock radio.Pros:-I've used it at work for an average of probably 4 hours/day and it's still on the first set of batteries after over a month and a half.-Good AM reception.Cons:-The left channel only headphone thing is really quite annoying. I got a mono to stereo adapter for it but it makes the radio a full inch wider and more awkward and it doesn't have the best connection so if I move the headphone wire too much, the radio will start playing out loud in my otherwise silent office building. Not okay. This could have been fixed at the factory for a fraction of a penny added cost. All it takes is a different headphone connector and an additional glob of solder.-The volume knob is absolutely unusable. I shouldn't have to hold the radio with both hands and as carefully as possible nudge the volume knob up to begin hearing anything, only to have my ear drums burst when the sound finally does show up.  And the first half turn of the dial is complete dead space, and the max volume is waaayyy beyond the distortion level. Awful.Buying a set of Sony headphones with inline volume control set to minimum makes it more bearable, but still a terrible design. Not to mention they cost 150% of the price of this entire radio. They, however, are worth it.-I've read about people saying this radio is great because it has an external antenna and doesn't use the headphone cord for reception. Great, but not true.  I've found manipulating my antenna does next to nothing whatsoever, whereas moving the cord can be the difference between perfect reception and getting a completely different station in epic fuzz. I've also found the radio completely unusable without a 3' extension for this purpose. This wasn't always the case, and I've noticed my reception getting worse and worse day by day. Needs batteries, right? Well, a brand new set of batteries made no difference, so I'm beginning to conclude the radio is just dying before it even uses the first set of batteries fully.-You might think, oh, well this guy just is in a dead zone for radio and is trying to get long distance stations.  Well, that's not the case. I'm in a highly populated city listening to local stations. My big comparison is that the radio feature on my 5 year old Sony Ericsson phone gets the same station in the same spot perfectly clear without a headphone extension when this radio requires precise placement of the almost 6 feet of combined headphone cable with extension. Antenna fully up and extended is no different than folded away.2 stars for the battery life and AM reception. I would say it might be worth the money if you bought it for use without headphones, but unless you listen to talk radio only, I wouldn't be able to deal with the sound quality for an extended period. A deal at ten bucks? Hardly."",)"
"('Where can you get anything that provides this much fun and usability for $12.97 shippped?  Tell me!  I want to know!!I bought this to have something that would play tunes while I was outside digging in the garden.  Little did I know I would fall in love with it.PRO\'s:  It looks good.  It has clear sound.  Excellent vocal intelligibility.  Amazing volume and throw for it\'s small size.  It\'s a marvel of excellent design within a price point.  It\'s inexpensive enough that you won\'t cry for the financial loss if it gets stolen.  You will cry however because you will bond with this damn thing!  It\'s cute!  It\'s a throwback.SUMMARY:  In a time when everything is supremely over priced and fails to deliver, this thing delivers.  Who thought a plastic device could be beautiful in it\'s reliable humility?  It\'s the best cheap, low hassle device you will ever own!CON\'s:  Of course it has no bass.  So what?  At this price?  What do you expect.IF YOU WANT REAL BASS IN A COMPACT RADIO * and * a STEREO HEADPHONE OUTPUT:  Then ** instead ** go with THIS-->  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FEQVENM/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1The Melosound S8 sounds twice as good as the Sony, but then again it costs THREE times as much.  It\'s also about a 1/3rd larger in size.  I can say that the Melsound S8 is a absolute wonder.  Music sounds excellent on it.  Scope,function and price point.  Each radio has it\'s place and yes you do get what you pay for.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!_______________________________________________________MONO OUTPUT VS. YOUR STEREO HEADPHONES.P.S. Mono (1 speaker) sound output is * SO *  long ago for most younger people that they wonder why their stereo ear buds only work on one channel with this unit. They even think this unit\'s headphone jack is broken/defective/who knows.What you need are ""Dual Mono"" or ""Dual Monoaural"" earbuds.  They are not very common anymore but they exist.Here is one example:  http://www.amazon.com/Headset-E-20-Dual-Monaural-Earphone/dp/B000ET2N5M/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid;=1401255025&sr;=8-6&keywords;=dual+mono+headphones+3.5mm+olympusPlan B:  Alternately you could obtain a converter plug.  Specifically a 3.5mm stereo female jack to 3.5mm mono male plug adapter for probably around 3 or 4 dollars.  I don\'t recommend this as these converter plugs are relatively bulky and, due to their size and the way they stick out, they will put stress on this little radio\'s earphone jack.______________________________________________________________________________ADDENDUM/TECHNO-CRAP/EXPLANATION:  WHY DID THEY BUILD THIS THIS WAY?WHAT FOLLOWS IS BORING. YOU * HAVE * BEEN WARNED!  : )*  The mono transistor radio is a throwback to the late 60\'s.  While stereo grew in importance, it was a luxury for portable devices back then.*  To support delivering audio to 2 separate channels, Stereo headphones require a plug with 3 sections: a ""TRS"" or Tip, Ring, Sleeve plug.  *  The tip of a TRS stereo plug is the Left side speaker(or earbud\'s) positive signal, the Ring (middle section between the bands on the plug shaft) is the Right side speaker(or earbud\'s) positive audio signal and the shank (longest metal part closest to the plastic base) is a shared common ""ground"".---->  In a Mono radio, the female headphone output ""jack"" has NO third metal conductor/sensor inside it to make contact with the Ring part of a stereo plug.  &lt;----The cool thing would have been if they wired it for dual mono at the factory but that would have added another wire & soldering process, a different jack, driving expense up, yadda yadda.  This thing is what it is: OLD SKOOL shabby chic to the max.  Deal with it.  If you crave dual speaker audio, then find dual mono headphones like referenced above.Over and Out. Meep Meep!',)"
"('I\'ve always wanted a good macro lens for small subjects and really up close photography.  I finally decided to pull the trigger and buy the Tamron 90mm f/2.8 Di macro.  This is a beautiful lens that looks good on my Pentax K5 camera.  I was pleased with the way it operates.  Auto focusing is smooth and quiet.  Images taken were clear and sharp with good color rendition.  No distortions of any kind were seen and the viewfinder image was bright and clear, utilizing its large/fast f/2.8 lens opening.The lens will autofocus down to about 10"".  Closer than that, and you will need to switch to manual focus.  At those very close distances the depth of field is so shallow, autofocus would not be critical enough anyways.  I do not keep the lens on my camera all the time.  For my all around lens, I prefer a fast zoom lens like my Tamron 70-300 zoom.The Tamron 90mm macro is also the perfect lens for portrait work.  It will provide a terrific bokah effect and is just the right focal length for flattering portraits.I don\'t think you can go wrong buying this lens.  Tamron has been making lenses for as long as I can remember.  I have owned many of them and have never had a problem.PROS:1.  THE lens for macro work.2.

"('I had been researching HDD/DVD recorders for several months, and finally decided on this unit for five reasons:1) TV Guide On Screen feature.2) Panasonic\'s reliability record.3) Adequate number of good reviews.4) Unit is physically very compact.5) Low price for what it does.You must read the manual.  Let me repeat:  You must read the manual.  So that my manual wouldn\'t get mutilated from excessive handling, I downloaded the pdf version from Panasonic\'s website.  Actually did this prior to receiving the unit, so I could get a head start on knowing how to use it.  If you\'re the type of person who hates reading manuals, this unit is not for you.  A lot of functions and buttons are NOT intuitive.  I\'m guessing that most of the trouble people have with this unit is due to impatience and failure to read the manual.This is like FOUR devices in one:1) Records like a VCR, but without tape or discs.2) Plays and records DVD\'s.3) TV Guide provides TiVo-like capability.4) Editing machine.Hooking it up is straightforward following the diagrams provided.  Some people report trouble with the TV Guide feature, but both its setup and usage were great for me.  I should point out that I\'m a techhead, so I have an aptitude for these things.  Also, I have cable but no cable box, which simplifies the arrangement.  For the initial TV Guide setup, you have to answer a few easy questions, such as:  What\'s your zip code?  Do you have a cable box?  Then you must turn the unit off and LEAVE IT OFF for 24 hours so it can download the TV Guide listings.  A few minutes after turning it off, I noticed that the clock had set automatically, which is a good sign.  Any channels that aren\'t downloaded automatically can be entered manually.  In my case, the only channel I noticed missing is a local public access channel which I never watch anyway.Before you do any recording, make sure you turn on high speed dubbing, so that any copying done from HDD to DVD will happen quickly.I find the TV Guide feature to be a huge improvement over manual programming or VCR Plus.  Not as sophisticated as TiVo, although some users might actually find it easier than TiVo.  An obvious limitation is that the listings only go for 8 days, but if you want to record something beyond that timeframe, information can be entered manually or via VCR Plus.  Remember that although its scheduling isn\'t as advanced as TiVo, overall this unit does much more than TiVo.Recording shows to the HDD (hard disk) is a joy!  No more time spent aggrevating over which shows are on which tapes, no more endless rewinding and forwarding, and no more concern about accidentally recording over a favorite show.  I\'ve recorded several shows, and even though I used one of the slower speeds (LP), the quality is good.  Once a recording is on the HDD, commercials and other unwanted segments can be removed (this is called ""shorten""), with frame-by-frame precision if desired.  A ""title"" (recording) can be renamed, and can be divided into chapters.  And impressively, chapters can be combined.  So if you break a chapter into two, but then decide you divided at the wrong place, just put them back together and split again.  I\'m building an ""online"" library on the HDD, which includes newly recorded shows as well as recordings transferred from VHS and eventually camcorder.  Copying from VHS to HDD is easy and gives great results.  Of course, since this unit can\'t play VHS directly, you\'ll need to connect a VCR to use for copying.  I plan to do all my recording onto the HDD, and only transfer to DVD if it\'s something I want to save permanently, view somewhere else, or give to somebody.Pressing one button on the remote takes you into the title list, which consists of a thumbnail picture of each recording on the disk.  Underneath each thumbnail is the name and date of the recording, and conveniently, a recording can be renamed.  Use the arrow buttons on the remote to scroll through the thumbnails, the press the enter button to watch your selection.  If you prefer, the thumbnail display can be changed to a list format.Transferring from HDD to DVD is fast and easy!  Not surprisingly, the manual suggests Panasonic blank DVD\'s, but those are overpriced so I took a chance with off brand ""Velocity"" (from Amazon).  So far, three successful DVD-R burns with no coasters!  Discs must be finalized to play on other units, but prior to finalization, additional titles can be added.  I don\'t see any reason to bother with DVD-RAM discs, as they cost more and have limited compatibility with other DVD players.Like most remote controls, this one is less than what it should be.  Because of its poor layout and small buttons, some tasks that should be doable with one hand require two hands.Despite the remote\'s shortcomings, this device is remarkable!  After using the TV Guide and the HDD, I can\'t imagine buying a DVD recorder that doesn\'t have both of those extremely useful features.  Things have improved quite a bit since I bought my first VCR, for $700, back in 1982!To Summarize:- Proo Hard Disk revolutionizes the entire TV and video experience.o Allows the user to have an ""online"" library of favorite recordings.o Good picture and sound, even at lower LP speed.o Impressive editing capability.o TV Guide On-Screen.o Inexpensive for what it does.o Compact size.- Cono MUST read the manual.o Requires time and patience to master.o Some remote buttons are small, inconveniently placed, confusingly labeled.I recommend!',)"
"('I purchased a PowerBook 15"" 1.5Ghz 128VRAM computer around Christmas.  I\'ve built several IBM/PC-based desktop systems, from my first 486DX266 to my most recent 3.04Ghz Dell rebuild (looks like a Dell, but doesn\'t quack like one).  I know what ""right"" looks like, and Apple has finally gotten it right.The design of the iBook and PowerBook is top-notch.  A very tight chassis, maximized screen, and overall clean finish with each model.  The software took this Microsoft-handicapped user about an hour to figure out, but if you work with it enough, you\'ll find you can learn something new every day.  Reliability is also the best I\'ve ever seen.  There are no ""blue screens of death"" on Mac\'s.  My wife\'s old G3 displayed a ""sad Mac"" once, but that was on a Mac from another era.  I haven\'t heard of anyone having ""show-stopper"" problems with the G4\'s.I had a few peripherals that I didn\'t want to part with, like my Dell Axim.  Not to worry.  PocketMac (a 3rd-party answer to PocketPC and ActiveSync) allows me to sync data between PowerBook and PDA effortlessly.  The keyboard, mouse, and even monitor can all be used with the PowerBook when I\'m at my desk.Who needs computer speakers when you can play iTunes through your home stereo (with an Airport Express in the mix).  When it comes to games, quality headphones do the trick.The 80GB HD is a lot smaller than what I have in my Dell, but I\'ve invested in a Lacie D2 external drive which puts me at ease when storage is a concern.With Office for Mac, I can open, edit, and save any OfficeXP file I can find.  No compatibility issues whatsoever.WARNING:  If you intend to play PC games on a Mac by using VirtualPC... DON\'T!  That\'s not what VirtualPC was designed for, and the results will show that.  If you want to play games on a Mac, visit the Aspyr website and buy the Mac versions.The price was higher than what some would expect to pay for a comparable PC laptop.  Extras are expensive, and are probably where Apple really makes their money.  Custom configurations are non-refundable/non-returnable, as clearly stated on the Apple website.  If you customize (which you have to, if you want the 128MB video card), plan on handing over another $300+ for the AppleCare Protection Plan.  That\'ll give you 3 years service and support - the alternative to being stuck with a lemon six months after purchase - if you\'re unfortunate enough.Me?  I guess I got lucky according to one reviewer.  Everything worked out of the box, and continues to work as advertised.  From what I can tell, that\'s not lucky - that\'s the norm.As I use the PowerBook more frequently, I find myself going to my Dell less and less.',)"

"('The Sony DAV FR1 looks and sounds great, but it does not exactly set the standard for cutting edge technology for home theatre systems.It comes with the 5 speakers and 1 woofer and the 5 disc DVD player.Speakers:They are 100 watts each. Powerful.. very powerful. I have a huge living room and the speakers filled the room with sound. But there are 2 aspects which bother me, viz.1) The surround speakers should have had a system by which they could be connected wirelessly. Panasonic makes a similar home theatre system, which has that wireless feature. Although, Panasonic sells the wireless system to connect the surround speakers seperately. Nevertheless, it is comforting to know that when you have a few extra dollars lying around, you can avail that system and get rid of the wires lying around on the carpet. You have no way of doing that with this Sony model.2) Stands. In this day and age, we simply dont have the time or resources to go out and fit fixtures on to the wall for the surround speakers. And I dont want to spend a penny more (let alone $40 for the Sanus stands) for additional stands for the speakers. The lack of this feature is indeed very irritating. I dont understand why some thing which can be made so cheaply (the stands) cant be provided with a system which is so expensive.The DVD Player :The DVD player is old technology. PERIOD!1) It has a dot illumination type display system, which ruins the otherwise sleek appearance of the system. But it is better than an LCD Display because you can make out the information being displayed while seated at a distance of a few feet.2) The DVD Player boasts a 5 disc system, which is a major convinience, since you wont have to get up to change discs time and again. Some people have said it takes some time for the discs to load, etc... but I found the speed to be quite normal. Please remember, even in a $3000 worth laptop - it does take some time for the CD drawer to eject when you press the button. This system is no different, it is NOT slow.3) The DVD player has 2 speeds for fast forward and rewind. That is a far cry from the 1,1.5,2,4,8,16,32 speed levels available even in my other $17.00 Desay DVD Player (The Desay is an individually lousy player - dont even think of buying it. And the manufacturer and Circuit city didnt honor the mail in rebate forms for it.)  But that is not a major factor. Given the chapter forward/rewind feature, the 1X and 2X speeds are reasonably acceptable.4) The DVD Player plays DVD videos, SACD (Super Audio CD\'s - I have no idea what they are) and a host of CD types, viz. CD-R, CD-RW, etc. I have no idea if this DVD player can play Divx or AVI or MPEG files. And normally DVD players dont. And this one doesnt seem to be an espcially new old technology. Besides that, it doesnt say on the manual that this can play DVD-RW or DVD-R/+R.So if I am cribbing so much, why did I rate it 4 stars?Simply because it looks and sounds great.Set up was simple, the sound was AMAZING!!!!!!! I did not dare to increase the volume more than 50% of its capability for the fear of bothering my neighbors.The DVD remote is great. I really like the feature wherein the most commonly used buttons are exposed, and the other ones hidden under a sliding cover. I also like the innovative battery placement system of this remote - it is to the front side, and to access it, you have to just slide the cover completely off the front.This system also provides a host of other features like FM and AM playing capability, ability to accomodate a game system (X-box or Play station), an additional surround speaker system, a satellite feed, etc etc. It has component video out, S video out, and monitor out (yellow jacketed cable). So no matter what, you will be able to use the speakers with a host of other devices.Bottom line, if you are concious about the amount of money you spend on a home theatre system, then this is an excellent buy. The brand name of Sony commands a lot of respect. People like seeing the name ""Sony"", and this was indeed a factor under consideration when I chose this system.You will like the sound. If some one says this is not enough, he either needs to get his ears checked, or he has not connected the speakers properly.A home theatre system is primarily for its woofer and speakers, the DVD player is just an additional contrivance. And I am totally satisfied with the DVD player too. I would think, spending $300 on this system is totally justified.Thanks,Kaushik.',)"

"('Works great in my RV ( travel trailer ). Really fills in the tinny sounds form the stock speakers and stereo.',)"
"('What caught my eye about the JVC DR-MV1SL was that it boasted VHS playback in progressive mode! There are S-VHS VCR players that will playback an S-VHS tape in S-VHS mode (400 lines of resolution). But these VCRs will play regular VHS tapes like any ordinary VCR player, with just 230 lines of resolution. When you have an HDTV (mine is the 50"" Samsung DLP HDTV), the lower resolution VHS tapes really start to look bad.So, coming back to the DR-MV1SL, the specs say it can play a regular VHS tape in progessive mode, which is 480 lines progressively scanned (not interlaced, like S-VHS or regular VHS). This should account for a really good picture. And that was my primary reason for buying this DVD/VCR combo. Here\'s some very useful stuff I found out:1) The unit does indeed play a VHS tape in 480 progressive mode. But the quality was not always much better. The picture was somewhat sharper, and more full of color. But I also started to notice a lot more jagged lines. In defense of this unit, there\'s really only so much you can do with a lower quality signal. This unit tries its best to upgrade that signal - but the end result was not so spectacular. A little better, but not much.2) Limited use of dubbing VHS tapes due to copyright protection. You were probably aware that this unit would not dubb VHS tapes onto DVD if the tape had a copyright signal on it. But did you know that ALL Disney and Pixar tapes are copyright protected? My wife has almost a 100 of these Disney animation tapes and I thought I\'d pick our favorite ones to backup onto DVD. Surprise, surprise, not ONE could be copied. Even the old Disney tapes like Cinderella, Lion King, etc. - none of them could be copied.3) But if you\'re lucky enough to find a tape that you can copy onto DVD, the results are very good. I managed to find 5 VHS movies that I could copy onto DVD (Mission Impossible, Jumanji, etc.). 4 of them came out perfect, just 1 of them had a 3 second skip in the middle of the movie. But that VHS tape was very old and poor quality.4) Recording TV programs onto DVD is nice and easy. The resulting picture also looks quite nice, sometimes even better than the original TV broadcast signal.5) The unit will only record on DVD -R, -RW and -RAM formats. It won\'t record on any of the +s (I tried a DVD +R and it didn\'t work). Also, the recording speed of the discs doesn\'t seem to matter (nothing is mentioned about disc speed in the manual). I tried a 4x and an 8x - no difference in terms of recording time and end quality. Also, the unit will playback almost ALL the formats (I tried a recorded DVD +R and it worked fine).There were few more minor details (like the blue light, which can be totally dimmed, the remote which can get confusing since the buttons double up for the VCR and DVD - but this is probably true of all VCR/DVD combos and you eventually get used to it). But I figured the points I mentioned above were the most important and most useful (at least to me) and they were not really mentioned clearly anywhere else.Summarizing: Picture quality is great with the DVD, VHS tapes look a little better using the progressive output. Copyright protection of tapes (like with Disney) make it impossible to backup tapes onto DVD.Overall, I think this is a very nice unit with lot of packed features in it. However, I returned mine back to BestBuy primarily because I couldn\'t backup my Disney collection, because VHS playback was only a little better, and because the price I paid was a little too much (around 400). If this ever went on sale for less than $300, I\'d seriously consider buying it and keeping it.UPDATE (11/17/04):I still think this unit is very nice and I\'m sticking to my 4 star rating. However there were some things I forgot to mention before and some new information about OTHER products (from JVC) that I think would be useful to those shopping around.1) I forgot to mention that NO AV cables come with this unit (No RCA cables, no S-Video cables). Only 3 (that\'s right, three) RF-cables and an RF splitter. At first I thought this was a mistake, but then I checked the manual and it confirms the same.I thought that that was bad of JVC. This unit is noted for its progressive output - they should have at least included one component video cable!2) JVC also has another new model out right now - the DR-MX1S which is basically this unit (DR-MV1S) + an 80GB hard drive. So essentially, it\'s a 3 in 1 - sounds very nice. Depending on where you look, the MSRP of the DR-MX1S varies - the JVC website has the MSRP at $999, Amazon has it at $1099 and I\'ve seen some other websites that list it as high as $1299. Of course, MSRP doesn\'t matter that much as long as you can get a good price. Amazon currently has it listed for a fairly competitive price of $699. I suspect it\'ll go lower in time.I would love to try out the DR-MX1S since I think a hard drive is best for daily recordings of TV shows. But I\'m waiting for it to be available at my local store first.3) JVC also has an OLDER model - the HR-XVC37U that supposedly does the SAME thing as this unit (the DR-MV1S) in that it can display VHS in progressive mode! It\'s also a DVD/VCR combo like this unit, but it\'s also a lot less expensive since it does not have the capability of a DVD recorder. Amazon has it listed as the HRXVC37U, in case you want to search for it here.So, there ARE other options. An older, less expensive JVC model (without DVD recording capability) or a newer, more expensive JVC model (with an added hard drive). Just thought some might find this information useful. Happy shopping!',)"

"('Okay, I bought this headset from Tiger Direct a year ago. I loved this headset, and I don\'t want to sound like a nerd but I was heartbroken when it finally kicked the bucket. I just purchased a new one through Amazon after trying a different headset and hating it, so thats why I\'m writing this review, because I see a handful of negative reviews and I personally think those people are nuts.Heres some FYI\'s for the people who read the reviews and go ""Well....I don\'t know...""For 20-25 bucks, you cant go wrong. I use it for playing video games. The normal sound quality is nice. With the bass it\'s insane. I played Battlefield 2 and Call of Duty 4 with the bass on, and it is simply insane.Like a few reviwer\'s said, it really doesn\'t go insanely high. I had it plugged into my stereo system so that made a difference on how high I could make it go, but at any rate its still decent sound levels.It does get uncomfortable wearing it, but I only notice the discomfort after like 4-5 hours of constant use. Other than that its comfortable.The cable quality where it connects into the headset its self isn\'t that good and will be the first place the wire will go bad. But this is just from my point of view. If you\'re not the type of person who puts headsets through hell, you\'ll be fine with this. I really kick the crap out of my headsets but it did last a little over a year with all that abuse.I did have an issue with the material that covers the inside of the speaker around the squishy foam stuff constantly falling out, but its not THAT big of a deal, if it bothers you that much, just stick some glue on it like I did. It wont come out again.The microphone sound from what I\'ve been told sounds nice. I\'ve recorded my voice a few times and it sounded good. Its clear, and picks up your voice really well even if you have the mic at a distance away.If you constantly use the bass boost effect it will wear out within 6 months. Which isn\'t a big deal, because you don\'t HAVE to turn it on. Its completely optional.One thing they didn\'t point out (or at least I didn\'t see) is this headset has simulated 5.1 surround sound, or atleast it sounds that way. If you\'re playing a game and someone shoots at you or something explodes, you know exactly where it happened or where the shot came from. Theres no guessing or turning in the direction and scanning for the enemy you know almost a pin point location of where the shot came from.I did mention a handful of negative things but COME ON! the headset is [...] dollars, and its sound quality in my opinion is a 4 out of 5. This product over all is a 4 out of 5 maybe even a 4.5 out of 5. You cannot go wrong with this headset for [...] bucks. Not at all. I\'ll keep buying these until I find something better.',)"

"(""I got the Vector 995 because its performance is at par with the top of the line radar detectors from Bel, Escort, Valentine. Even though I rarely speed above general traffic flow, speed enforcement has picked up a lot and I didn't want to pay back-door taxes.Its radar detection performance is at par with the best of them - usually just 5% or so less than the best for a given test. But the cost difference is way more than 5%, more like 25%+. Its laser detection is its weakness, but only when compared to the top of the line models. However, the laser detection weakness isn't really critical because laser guns are so fast and accurate that the officer has already clocked your speed before even the detector alerts (even the best one). Don't take my word for it, just go ask your local police officer. Also, the rear facing sensor is quite useless on most detectors - someone in marketing thought it would be cool and all other brands followed. It is also one of the very few detectors which can detect the Ku band, which is rumored to be introduced in the US soon (already there in Europe).It also falses significantly less than what I've had before. I can't compare with the top 4 because I don't have them. AutoScan works best in city or when in new areas; Highway works best on rural areas or highways. Use AutoScan with care, it filters all bands and can potentially reduce detection range (because it spends some time figuring out if the radar signal pattern is like those from typical sources of falsing). Its Tech mode (showing radar freq) can be used to find out real speed gun threat when a cunning officer hangs out in an area where detectors often false (drugstore, grocery store, etc) - not fool proof though. One should note that the 'false alerts' are not really false - they ARE actually radar signals in the same band used by police. It's called 'false' because it's not a 'cop' radar signal.POP mode, while a nice feature, usually trigger a lot of falsing on most detectors - because of leaky/crappy detectors like the Cobras. I've enabled POP for the last 3 weeks and have run it in AutoScan and City modes - no difference in falsing. Even the top 4 detectors today can't beat this. Also, the review/description is wrong - POP is disabled by default on the 995 also (maybe Bel changed it after the review).The Vector 995 is the only one in the Vector series that can have its firmware upgraded by Beltronics - useful if they have some bug fixes and/or they have an update that does better detection.It also has a few less features than the top 4, but I didn't care for those. Its got all the essential features one really needs for its intended use and does them extremely well. Its stellar performance makes it an awesome deal for a $225 price. I got mine on a special sale at Amazon for even less :). However, like any radar detector (even the best ones), this radar detector is NOT a cop detector - so drive sensibly.Even when the 995 is having a bad day, it is waaaaay better than the most expensive Cobra/Whistler radar detectors.Like any product, it has quirks:1. 3.5mm jack volume - it's just too loud even at one click above minimum (I use it when spouse/kids are sleeping on a long drive)2. Buttons for visor clip - if you get the visor clip, the buttons are not easy to reachAnd last but most important, please drive carefully. Lives are more important than seconds/minutes saved by excessive speeding and rash driving.Bonus tips:a. Tutorial mode - manual doesn't mention it, but I stumbled on it. Press the Dark and Mute buttons down and then the Power button to turn the unit on. Voila - tutorial mode!! Power button press exits this mode.b. Audio/Voice alerts - learn to identify the bands with your ears, the range based on audio beep frequency, it helps keep your eyes focused where they need to be - on the road. I've turned Voice off after a couple of months, and rarely need to look at it (except in Tech mode).c. Ebay/Unauthorized dealers - Beltronics honors warranty from authorized dealers only. Amazon itself is authorized (may change in future), Amazon's sellers are not. Ebay is not, most stuff there are refurbs or rejects and hence the low low prices. You've been informed, use common sense."",)"

"('I think  Kluutmahn ""Audio Pragmatist"" goes into great detail about this amp.  I second his thoughts, and here are a few of my own.I own 3 of these amps.  I\'ve owned them for about a year and a half.  I didn\'t buy them here but wouldn\'t hesitate, the price here is the best i\'ve seen.  I don\'t have multiple inputs, i only have my computer running into them.  I have an 8in/8out audio card.  So i have 1 set of outs going to the first amp which is daisy-chained with the second amp using the output of amp 1 to input 2 of amp 2.  I have the 3rd amp (for speakers at my bed) on a second set of outputs of my audio card.All of my sound producing equipment (TVs, Computers, Record Player, DVD,  Mutitrack, etc...) are all run into my audio card on my primary computer.  All the switching between audio sources is done on the computer.  The Audiosource amps receive the output from the computer.I use input 2 for the auto power off feature, which is the reason i chose this amp.  Auto power off works great.  Once in a great while i\'ll run across something that is very quiet and won\'t trigger the amps to turn on, but that is very rare.  Normal audio will trigger the amp in a second or two.  Before i bought these amps i was concerned that the amps might switch on switch off (quick switching) during quiet passages of a song but that is not the case.  It doesn\'t switch immediately off.  I\'m not sure how long it takes for it to decide to switch off but i\'m guessing at least 30 seconds or a minute (maybe when i get home tonight i\'ll time it).As for the volume and bass, i have 16 Polk audio Monitor30 series speakers distributed throughout my small apartment.  8 speakers on each amp (series/parallel), except the third amp is only powering 2 JBL speakers.  I don\'t have all these speakers to play it loud, i wanted sound wherever i walk (bathroom, kitchen, living room, bedroom) which i have.  The sound will get very loud if i turn it up.  I have a special EQ configuration to knock out some bass (Mr Icarus Jones\'s fault) to prevent bothering the neighbors.  Now i\'m not one of those guys who needs bass like some of these cars you can hear a block away.  I just need even sound which i have with this setup.  If i were to add a sub woofer i\'m sure these amps will power it just fine, but i\'m content with the bass i have.I haven\'t had any buzz problems.  I do some amateur audio recording and am very sensitive to slight noise.  A slight noise/buzz would drive me crazy, especially all over the apartment (i have speakers everywhere).  I can confirm that there is 0 noise/buzz.  These are quiet.I have these amps rack mounted on a standard 19 inch rack.  i used 3 sets of1U mounting brackets for open post rack SA-3201to mount the amps.  I had to add 1/4 inch of wood to each side to fit it correctly and this works well.  I also picked up some longer screws from the hardware store to put this together.In conclusion, i needed a basic amp, inexpensive, clean sound and an auto on/off feature, this amp was the perfect solution.  I never concern myself with turning the amps on or off, when i turn on/off my source of audio, everything else is automatic.---------------UPDATE September 27th 2012--------------------I think i bought my first one of these amps 2 or 3 years ago, i currently have 3.  I\'m extremely satisfied with these amps.  I will not hesitate buying more of these.---------------UPDATE April 7th, 2014-------------------------I\'ve been running 3 of these for about 4 or 5 years.  Tonight i turned one on and immediately smelled an electrical burn.  I looked through the rack and spotted smoke coming out of one of the AudioSource AMPs.I didn\'t hesitate ordering another tonight.  It\'s been a great AMP.',)"

"('i wrote this originally about the 40gb model, which i own, but my comments are equally applicable to the 20gb model, since they are otherwise identical:i really do like this player; it\'s great, super-fast (near-instant boot time, fast shutdown) and the battery life is stellar: i drove from austin to dallas and back--5 hours of driving--playing 128-to-320kbps VBR mp3s and the battery is still at 3 bars (out of 3.)the problem i have with it is that the touchpad is just annoying. even at lowest sensitivity, it\'s far too easy to accidentally scroll up or down by 2 items instead of 1. i would say 90% of the time when i try to make the tiniest possible gesture, it either doesn\'t scroll or scrolls by 2 items.what really gets me, though, is that the touchpad is just not the right mechanism for this. if it were obviously a great idea that just needed a little tuning, i\'d be fine with it. but really, a set of four buttons--up, down, page up, page down--would be better in every way.with the touchpad, you have to be looking at the player to use it. i know my way around many of the context menus without looking at them, now, but i *have* to look at them since i don\'t know, using the touchpad, how far i have scrolled if i don\'t. with buttons i could easily click \'down\' 3 times and know where the cursor was. this is actually a pretty serious problem while driving.i didn\'t know this until i got the player, but the touchpad is divided into 3 regions; the top third is for ""fast upwards scrolling"", the middle for ""precise scrolling"" and the bottom for ""fast downwards scrolling."" so they\'ve already discretized this supposedly-analog touchpad, and even then it\'s often hard to use even on low sensitivity. with buttons, problem solved.one nice thing about the touchpad is that with a very fast, full-pad swoosh downwards or upwards you can scroll through a hundred or more items instantly. but you could set up the page up and page down buttons so that if you held them for more than a few moments, they rapidly started scrolling up or down, and it would really be just as effective.other reviews say things like ""the touchpad is not bad once you get used to it"" or whatever. first of all, i\'m unconvinced; i\'ve been using this thing every day for several weeks now and it\'s still irritating to use: i\'ll seriously scroll up and down by 2 items 4 or 5 times just trying to home in on the item between them, which is frustrating.but furthermore, the fact is the touchpad is completely unnecessary. buttons would be better in every way. seems like creative made the touchpad decision more to copy the iPod than because it was actually a good design idea, which is unfortunate.nonetheless, like i said, i love the player; the sound quality is good, the size is nice, the battery life is incredible and the integration with my windows xp machine is really pretty seamless.',)"
"('We bought the creative touch (40 gb) and an ipod video 30gb (recently).  Also purchased the muvo and the toshiba gigabeat.  The gigabeat died within a few days.  The muvo is great for a flash player.  But the ipod has some real problems.The creative is better than the ipod for us because of file sharing and file backups.  The ipod will attach to ONE COMPUTER ONLY and it KNOWS if you try to get it to work with another.  This caused us a lot of grief when we switched computers.  Then the new computer we attached it to died and getting the music back off of the ipod was a real pain.  If you are able to even get the files back off the ipod (it doesn\'t like to go that direction, apparently) it still will lose a lot of the tag info in the music library.  (Wanna type all that in by hand?)  Plus, since Apple\'s music file format is proprietary, we can\'t share files from the ipod to other players.  (Does not play well with others! :-)The creative players do not have any of these problems.  They will work on ANY new computer and accept imports of a variety of file formats.  You can make as many backups of your music library on as many hard drives on as many computers as you like.Another difference is the sound quality and volume output.  Creative players drive headphones with higher impedances and also have superior sound.  Also, creative players have EQ settings that actually work!  They sound very different, but the ipod EQ settings pretty much all sound the same.  Furthermore, the creative players have custom EQ settings available if you don\'t like the presets that come with the player.The ipod is more attractive and a bit smaller than the creative, but such things don\'t concern me since I\'m looking for the highest quality sound I can get.  Unfortunately, few mp3 players on the market today are really audiophile quality, and the ones that are are only available in Korea.  Apparently the US market is more concerned with ""features"" and ""style"".There are a few problems with the creative software.  It has some bugs but is easy to use.  The ipod\'s software is also easy to use.  Both interfaces are easy to use, but the creative touch can sometimes be too sensitive.  It does have a sensitivity setting that helps a bit with that.The creative would be much better if it had a line out instead of  just the regular headphone jack.  I would be happier also if it could handle lossless compression formats, too, but this is not a major concern.What player a person buys really depends on their priorities.  I have no need to watch videos on a portable player (Although creative has a video player, too).  I\'m looking for non-proprietary file formats and good sound quality.  I\'ve seen a lot of my friends with ipods suffer the consequences of having the single computer attachment problem and proprietary file format issues.  That can be a very serious problem.  I understand there are third party software programs out there that may help some of these issues, but it still is a very suboptimal situation to have to deal with.Overall I\'m quite happy with this player.',)"
"(""I was upgrading some of my stereo equipment a few weeks ago and bought this Sony CD changer for the SACD capability.  Let me first say that I do not have multi-channel capacity.  To put it simply, I don't want a bunch of speakers with their wiring running all over the room and I'm pretty happy with 2-channel stereo.  I listen to a pretty wide range of music, from country to classical and I have a fairly good stereo system.  In addition to my main outfit, I've been using a Sony receiver and CD player at the back of the house to play music in the backyard through some outdoor Polk speakers.  The Sony equipment was originally purchased in 1985 and has served well.  I had no qualms about buying another Sony CD player.SACD's and CD's on the SCD-CE595 sound a little bright compared to CD's played on my main CD player made by Rotel.  Not harsh, but there is a tendency toward the treble.  This probably can also be accounted for by the B&W; speakers I use and their amazing clarity in the upper and mid-range.  Anyway, a simple counterclockwise turn of the treble control on the amp cleared this up immediately.  Julia Fischer's Russian Violin Concertos SACD was on the edge of harshness until I decreased the treble slightly.To my non-golden ear, there's not a lot of difference between 2-channel SACD and regular CD.  The SACD has a little more air around the music with a little more depth to the soundstage but, honestly, a well-recorded standard CD will give an SACD a run for the money.  I have Claire Martin's two most recent Linn recordings on SACD and I must confess that there's little difference in sound when played on the Rotel compared to the Sony or, in fact, comparing them to her older recording on regular CD.I don't have any complaints about the remote control.  It works very well within its limitations.  The only problem I encountered with this player is that it is too deep to fit on the shelves inside my stereo cabinet.  It's not insurmountable--I just set it on top and put the lamp on top of it.Last night, I had the displeasure to discover my 20-year old Sony CD player I use for outside listening was refusing to accept any discs.  It has finally died.  RIP.  Today, I'm ordering another of the SCD-CE595's to replace it.If I like it well enough to buy another, why not 5 stars?  The bright sound is one reason--it could sound a little smoother and 2-channel SACD's could be a little more open.  Also, I doubt today's Sony hi-fi equipment is as well-built as the stuff I bought 20 years ago.  Today's consumer electronics are of reasonable quality but disposable.  I doubt I'll get 20 years out of the SCD-CE595.It is now May 2006.  I've been living with these two disc players for long enough to revise my previous estimation.  Considering the price, this is a five-star SACD player.Over time, the sound has improved.  A lot.  What was originally overly bright has settled down.  The sound is now more open and revealing--the detail of SACD's is amazing.The player needs to be broken in.  Buy one, play it a lot and give it some time.  Patience brings great rewards.UPDATE 03/2013:  I've owned two of these Sony SACD changers since 2005, played music on them frequently and they continue to function perfectly and continue to provide hours of enjoyment.  Sadly, this changer has been discontinued and Sony lists a single SACD changer on their website (at $1500.00!).  Generally, SACD players are few and far between these days and very expensive when available.  It appears the SACD concept has faded away as more people get their music from downloads.  That is also sad but not unexpected."",)"
"('First, I must say that you shouldn\'t take into account the review written by someone who obviously DOESN\'T own the machine. It is true that many applications don\'t use both processors, but that is because they don\'t need to (especially if they use like 15% of CPU power at all times). Key apps like Photoshop, Final Cut, DVD Studio etc. definitely benefit, with average 60% or more speed boost. Even Maya does (From Alias support page"" ""If your MAC has at least 1 GB - 2 GB of memory and dual G4 or G5 processor you can speed up rendering by starting 2 renders at the same time). If you multitask a lot, everything runs much smoother with DP (I tipically keep Quark, Illustrator, Photoshop, Safari, Mail and iTunes open at all times). This is a workstation class Unix machine and if you want to play games all the time, you\'re probably better of with a PC. I do Photoshop 80% of the time and having switched over from a 400 MHz G4, I am totally extatic.On the other hand, the fan system with its multiple heat sensors is very complex and it could turn out to be the problem in the future, hopefully I\'m wrong. RAM should be upgraded immediately with at least an extra 1 GB, since all duall processor machines need RAM installed in pairs, which fills all the ram slots with one upgrade. I still have the original video card with two monitors attached and it works fine for me, but then I don\'t do motion graphics; I imagine someone who does would want to change it ASAP since the performance boost would be dramatic. About the storage expansion, I use external FireWire drives. The machine is big and hevy (well, very SOLID) and I never move it, so not having the drives inside is not a problem and even FW400 is fast enough, let alone FW800. The design is actually beautiful in it\'s Bauhaus minimalism, with lots of character. In person it looks much better then the photos reveal and it\'s built like a tank.',)"
"('The spec of this camera is very good, but the build quality leaves much to be desired, such as:1.)  Flimsy pop-up battery.  The button is shallow to pop-up the battery and the flash mechanism is built of flimsy plastic.  When you close it it latches only to one side leaving one side higher than the other.  On one camera, the flash stopped mid-way from full extension.  This was the third camera that had some issue with the flash.  IMHO, this flash is geared for failure..........I hop on FUTURE cameras, Fuji will have the flash built-in--no moving parts please--and please no cover sliding doors like other cameras like Olympus or Canon (which also fail)!2.)  USB/AV port has an UNHINGED plastic cover.  When you upload your pics, the plastic cover has to come off.  Since it\'s unhinged to the body of the camera (unlike the competition), the plastic is engineered to be eventually lost.3.)  Cover handle creaks.  All E550 cameras I tried has this creak on the handle when you gripped it.  The plastic obviously is not glued on proficiently.  I hope on future cameras they use a solid well constructed rubber grip like Kodak for instance.4.)  Uses ULTRA expensive xD cards.  One shouldn\'t be buying such a camera if they don\'t fully intend to be using the FULL 6MP (or 12 MP interpolated) for pictures.  Otherwise save your money and get a 4 or 3MP camera!  Since 6MP picture files are large, you need substantial memory size (not to mention a good sized hard drive!).  A 512mb memory card is a good STARTING point.  In this regard, xD cards from Fuji or Olympus cameras cost 2-3x as much as the nearly universal SD or Compact Flash cards.  The pice difference is SUBSTANTIAL enough to make this camera a deal breaker.  For instance 1GB of Compact flash memory is $220+ cheaper than 1GB of xD!....That\'s enough memoy to upgrade one\'s camera to a markedly better level!Now the picture quality dings:1.)  No autofocus lamp for dim light pics.  The lack of the lamp causes the camera to take blurry and wrongly exposed pictures.  A AF lamp (like what other competitors have), will solve much of this problem.  The much more expensive brother F810 has the lamp, but it should be included on this model.2.)  Pictures has purple finging.  While smaller amounts of fringing was shown in high contrast outdoor pictures than Canon, for instance, the E550 still had more consistent fringing from pic to pic.  In other words, most of my outdoor pics had fringing--more than even Canon.  Though, when Canon shows the fringe on a picture, it\'s much more egregious and noticeable on a 4x6"".3.)  Many outdoor pics were overexposed on high contrast scenes.  The effect caused branches, architecture, for instance, to be bleached out or whited out......While many compacts outside the digital SLR have this problem, this camera had a higher than average bleaching.  So bad on some pics, as to be deleted!  The preview LCD won\'t be of use as it\'s too small to capture all the bleaching going on. This bleavhing problem was much worse than the fringing.  The fringing is much more forgiveable since it\'s smaller than the HUGE bleaching going on.4.)  Pictures such as grass shots are blurrier or muddier than competing 6MP cameras.  The Fuji CCD interpolates data differently thus adding detail in a manner that doesn\'t contribute to better detail.  The Fuji CCDs are very controversial in this regard among the pros.5.)  Flash takes 5-9 seconds to recharge from picture to picture!!  This is absolutely horrendous perfromance compared to other cameras!  By the time your flash is recharged, the picture taking opportunity is usually lost.Camera PROS:1.)  Great specs for it\'s pricepoint!  Many manual controls for the serious amateur.2.)  Good video.3.)  Glad they use AA\'s instead of expensive proprietary Li-Ion.4.)  Snappy start-up, zooming, and scrolling through pictures in memory.  One of the best out there in this regard.  Well done!5.)  Small size.6.)  No lens covers to fuss with.7.)  Lens starts at 32.5mm!  GREAT JOB!  Most small digicams start at 38mm which is abyssmal for close indoor or room shots.  32mm is a good repectable widezoom that I hope the rest of the industry will take heed!8.)  Good 4x zoom.  Better range than most 3x zoom cameras.9.)  Good, snappy Fuji colors on pics!All in all, this is a solid camera that will appeal to many on a budget.  I\'m a serious enthusiast picture taker, so I will be overly critical with any camera under $1000.  I think Fuji has a near budget classic on their hands if they take my suggestions to heart and make required changes.For me, the flimsy flash, creaky handle/construction, expensive xD cards, and bleaching/fringing in pictures is enough to supercede a purchase.  If these issues aren\'t important to you, then you should be very happy with this camera.  All in all, one of the better cameras in its pricepoint.',)"

I held off a day or so after getting it to try it out because honestly it looked intimidating at first since I had no idea how to use. I know, it\'s quite pathetic, but hey, just keeping it honest. Finally I gave in, read the quick and short instructions and gave it a go. The instructions were clear and easy to read and the products were easily labeled so those of us who have no knowledge of such products could use it with ease. I grabbed one of Sophias\' movie discs that was scratched and chose to do a repair on it. I put the repair products in as instructed and within just a minute or two the disc had completed. Since it wasn\'t too bad off I was completed with the process. If your disc still isn\'t working too great then of course you can do it again without harming you disc.I was very pleased to find that this product not only worked, but it worked quickly. I wouldn\'t suggest it for CDs with actual cracks or holes or anything of that nature, but wear and tear from normal use or some scratches from not being properly kept away is definitely a perfect example for what this product is for. I definitely recommend this product, especially for those with little ones around the house. You can both clean and repair discs and as I said, it does so quickly.

Nightime is the best time to explore far away stations on the lower SW bands & AM.A pair of 2000mah Lenmar AA rechargeable NiMi batteries lasted over 40 hours at about 10 - 4 hour intervals at a normal volume. They last longer at a lower volume or with headphones. Continuous use will be lower too. When testing battery life they last longer if given a break like in normal use. Continuous use will make the playing time as much as 1/3 less. If you play it real loud, the batteries will drain faster.With a pair of cheap batteries lasting that long, who needs a bulky wind-up or solar radio?Keep a set of alkalines handy if you want this as your emergency radio. NiMi rechargeables lose about 1/3 of their power per month just setting around. If the power goes out in your area, you won\'t be able to recharge them, & your local radio stations may be down. So DX & shortwave may be your only connection with the outside world & the news during an emergency. Alkaline AA batteries have a shelf life of years.The tuning dial is a little touchy but one quickly gets used to it after the first day of using it. SW tuning wasn\'t as touchy as expected for this type of tuner, & less touchy than other pocket radios. Tuning is analog, but the LCD readout is digital & accurate.Update 7/28/06 - Quote: ""I live in NJ - southern part - and planned on using the radio primarily for Yankee games (880 out of NY)""I\'m way across the state in Buffalo, NY, surrounded by tall steel-frame buildings, & pick up 880 from NYC clearly with this radio day or night. It is more sensitive than most ordinary pocket radios, & almost as sensitive on AM as my GE ""Super Radio"". But my E5, DX-394, DX-390, & DX-380 are far more sensitive on AM. The E5 is the most sensitive portable on all bands... even FM (Sony fanatics may disagree but actual real tests prove them wrong).',)"

"('Use your head when buying one of these tiny cameras. 5 MP does not mean you are buying a super high res camera. There are 4 MP units with larger lenses that can outperform a camera like this to some degree. I got the Optio S5I as a SECOND camera to supplement the bulky 8 MP Nikon 8800 that I also use.Let me start with the negatives:I think the 1.8 display is so-so at best. You can\'t judge 100% when a reviewed pic is sharp or not. It shows some noise. Clearly they didn\'t go crazy over the screen quality.No focus assist lamp for very low light work, but amazing (really!) auto focus system in even dim light.Mediocre movie mode.Button placement is less than intelligent. Some folks will wonder why pentax put the power button next to the shutter release. It\'s fine once you train your fingers.Cradle does not sync via USB...duh! Why have a cradle at all?Built in memory is just an excuse to ship the camera with no SD card. The built in 10 meg will let you take 3 pics, so buying at least a 256 is a must.Here are the positives....With a little practice the camera can take some wonderful shots. I have taken indoor portraits with no problems. The AF system works very well in low light. Sharpness is better than I expected for such a tiny lens. The camera\'s size means it can go anywhere, even a shirt pocket. In daylight the Optio excels and there are plenty (19) of scene modes to play with. It also has a built filtering system with 9 colors and even a effects for slimming a subject! The camera also has a Program mode with manual WB, Focus and metering options. It allows for an unusual amount of control for such a compact P&S.; You\'ll even find a manual focus mode that works better than the one on my expensive Nikon. Pentax also sells a tiny remote control (20 bucks) for the camera and a underwater housing!On softness issues: Yes, I can see some softness with the camera at wide, mostly in the corners. You have to shoot a field of wheat to see it at all. It goes away if you just zoom in a bit.  8X10 Prints look FANTASTIC. Looking at ALL of the other cameras, they all have somewhat soft edges and some look soft overall, such as the little Minolta. I see the same kind of softness from the Sony L1 and Casios and the Optio is a smaller camera! If you\'re looking for a primary unit for ""serious"" or ""ciritcal"" shooting, an ultra compact is not the best way to go.While the cradle has no USB connectivity, it does allow you to charge two batteries at once. Nice.Overall the Optio S5I is well done, but a better screen and ergonomics would have been welcome. Casio sells the Z50 and Z55 which are just a hair larger, but feature better ergonomics. Panasonic has a new camera of the same size (Lx-7) with image stabilization, but the screen quality and battery life appear to be poor compared to the Pentax and Casio. The only other camera I considered was the Sony L1, but it has only 4MP and is too thick for a shirt pocket. A few folks have commented that the Pentax has a more film-like look than other cameras and I agree. Looking at sample pics from Casio, Sony L1, T1, the Pentax looked best. The T1 pics were very sharp, but looked very un-film-like. It\'s a subjective call obviously. The tiny Panasonic was even better, but I don\'t want to carry 3 batteries around and the Optio S5I is more than 100.00 cheaper.Camera is actually smaller in height and length than a credit card. It can be tough to hold, but you WANTED a tiny camera! This camera goes into a shirt pocket and only the Panasonic can match it for size. The Casio 100 is even thinner, but 3.2 MP is a deal breaker.If you want the smallest 5MP unit around, I doubt you\'ll be disappointed in the Pentax, but I\'d still hesitate to recommend it as a primary camera simply because a larger lens set will give you better shots for the same money. I\'m sure the next versions of all of these cameras will further improve.Good luck!Capt RB',)"

"('Just received this unit yesterday, and pumped it full of my ""stuff"".  It\'s playing one of the classical collections included on the hard drive as I write this review.Just how much more exciting can an mp3 player get?  Probably NOT ALOT.Even after two decades in the high tech arena, I am stunned by the ""novelty"" of backing up my entire customer contact database, ALL my client quotes and letters and such, a 350MB Outlook mailbox and hardly denting the storage on a device the size of two cigarette packs.ALL my Christmas (its Christmas, not Holiday) music, ALL my Audible audio books (couple dozen, mostly long ones), ALL my extended self-help stuff (alot), and the thing still has more than 25GB left.AWESOME.What\'s AWESOME:- The capacity for the price.  Even if you had to take a physical beating from some guy selling one on eBay, there would be no way to compete with the price/capacity proposition.  This fact may stem the sheep-like purchases of the iPod being sold at criminal prices . . because they can.- The earbuds are surprisingly high fidelity as long as your music isn\'t RRRREEEEEEEE-BOOM-BOOM-RRRRRRREEEEEEE!, which isn\'t really music so much as self-abuse anyway.- The battery, unlike so many portable product batteries, GIVES you the impression that it is there to power this thing all day long.  It is so surprisingly robust as to actually make it less disappointing when it finally gives up the ghost and needs a recharge.- The carrying case is almost unbelievable in construction and materials quality, for being a giveaway especially.  I have the new one with the window cut out.  The only GLARING item here is the hole that\'s missing for the power cord.  ?!?- The charger has a very standard AC cord that can be replaced without replacing the whole unit.  BRILLIANT.- The speed of data transfer is almost unbelievable given that its going over a USB cable to a ""couple of packs of cigarettes"".What\'s NOT awesome:- The controls are a bit ""scattered"" in their design.  While close to chunk-blowing, they don\'t actually go over the edge of the cliff.- The belt clip that is solidly sewn into the back of the case BLOWS CHUNKS.  Be CAREFUL about that.- I understand this unit used to have a scrolling wheel instead of a ""flipper"" wheel. Changing to the flipper was STUPID, although not the end of the world.  Creative Staff: next time, take the scrolling wheel off of a 5 year old Sony cell phone, and beat that design.- The dismal backlight, combined with the almost ""pretend"" contrast controls, and small text make the unit a real teaser for anyone who is remotely visually challenged.  Given that the display is bigger that some portable TV sets, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING regarding the text size?  The backlight on mine is NOTHING like the advertisment in terms of brightness and clarity.STILL, not a deal killer, but it aggravates my sciatica something awful.- A bit clunky size-wise, but for half the cost of the equivalent sheepPod, who cares?My Advice to Creative:- Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  I SAID, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  THAT IS TO SAY, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  MEANING THAT, Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.  What you should take away from this is that Your support reputation is the main PROBLEM with this unit, not the unit itself.- When the Thinking Cap slides off one\'s head and onto the floor in the design phase, the correct response is to PICK IT UP AND PUT IT BACK ON, straightaway.  Clearly, the folks at Apple secured theirs with duct tape when they designed the fiendishly overpriced sheepPod.  You need to do the same.The Upshot: One of the most AMAZING electronic devices of any sort I have ever seen or used for under $800.',)"
"(""its not wireless, its not even that expensive. But see if you can find it in your local computer store and type on it for a few minutes. You'll see right away why its been rated so highly by everyone.I still miss my old IBM model M (everyone's favorite keyboard) though it has long since been obsolete (no USB, too loud, too heavy, by today's standards, tho it had the best key-feel and feedback of any keyboard ever made). I havent been happy with any of the new keyboards since 1986! ;) Until now, that is.I initially went shopping for a Logitech Dinovo (or the S510, which is similar). After trying them out I decided against, since they were too similar to my toshiba laptop keyboard and I was looking for something less cramped.I came across this one at the store and liked it right away. For me it has the right balance of key-stroke depth and key-spacing. I feel it has just about all the 'positive feedback' and 'feel' as the old IBM M model. Now, you may ask: this keyboard is whisper-quiet and 'soft', while the M model was loud and clackety-clack-hard. How can they be compared? They can be compared in terms of the 'confidence' with which one can type on them, the equivalent typing speeds and error-free typing that both can produce. In my case, I type as well - fast and error free - on this keyboard as I ever did on the model M.It inspires typing-confidence.The keys feel substantive under your fingers, meaning you are always sure where you're finger is going. The tactile feedback is quite positive, though it has been described as 'soft'; I think 'bouncy' might be a better word. (Like the old model M, remember?) I think what makes the tactile feedback so nice is that I not only immediately know when a key has 'registered' after I press it, but I also immediately know when my finger has left that key. There's a little 'push'. So I almost never hit two keys at once, or hit a key out of sequence. My fingers fly across it - without the clackety clack, but with as much confidence.The rest of the stuff on the keyboard are luxuries, and nice ones - the zoom slider, the media and volume controls, and the 'favorites' buttons etc which I have mapped to my favorite applications. I'm sure I will use them. I especially like the 'calculator' shortcut key over the number pad. Its like having a built in calculator since it pops up immediately.The setup for personalizing the keys is very easy and intuitive. You should update the software to the latest version (in my case the CD was version 5.2 but there was a 5.5 update at microsoft.com/hardware.If you do a lot of work in front of the computer, you cant get a better keyboard than this in terms of substantive luxury and feel for a fraction of the price of most other keyboards. Other keyboards may be wireless, or sleeker looking, but dont get fooled. For just over 20 bucks you can get a keyboard that will truly make your job easier, connect reliably, and make your fingers fly with confidence.In sum: Typing comfort is a very subjective thing, but go try it out in a store if you can. Typing on this thing is like driving a go-kart: point and shoot. Feels like a Lexus, priced like a Honda."",)"

"(""I don't remember how I came to learn about this tool, but I bought it in a store for my Nikon D300 without reading any reviews.  I did try it out in the store and I was immediately impressed with the results so I bought it on the spot.The disk is amazingly well packaged.  It's packaged just like an iPod that I received some years back.  It doesn't have the scrimpy, we-don't-care Made-In-China feel.  It comes with a lanyard, a semi-rigid pouch that you can attach to your belt, a CD with all of the PDF instructions in multiple languages and a how-to video.Their web-site also has instructions on how to set the Nikon D300 pre settings.For years, from the time I got my first DSLR I've been plagued by color balance issues.  It seems that I have to color correct each and every photograph in Photoshop.  I shoot in RAW so that I have more control but it takes so much more work and time.  I'm also not very good with color correctly with PS.  I have all the instructions and I follow them carefully, but I always had problems getting the hang of it.I own gray cards but they're bulky and I don't walk around with one.  I also haven't had very good luck with them either. I'm sure it's my technique but I never did get the hang of it.Shooting under artificial light is a real pain. Auto WB never really works.I first tried the ExpoDisk in a room lit with CFs (Compact Fluorescent) bulbs.  I used the ExpoDisk as directed and I received absolutely perfect results the first time.  Then I tried another room lit with LEDs.  Again, perfect results.  I put a Gretamacbeth colorchecker chart in each of my test shots.  Every time, the whites are whites and the blacks are black. Zero color cast.I've never been able to photograph granite and achieve the correct color. After using the ExpoDisk, the granite color perfectly matches the first time.  When photographing faces, I'm utterly clueless obtaining the correct tones unless I have a Gretamacbeth colorchecker chart in the photograph and fiddle around with Photoshop.  Again, ExpoDisk to the rescue.Maybe it's the camera or maybe it's me, but I also have problems with color casts using a flash with the color balance set to flash.  The ExpoDisk washed those problems away.Shooting under different lighting sources is a challenge.  Which do I aim at?  Unfortunately, the ExpoDisk never addresses that issue.  I probably have to use colored gels on the flash (I have the SB-900 and SB-800's) to neutralize the fluorescent bulbs.I don't intend to use this while casually walking around but when I want to be certain that the color balance is perfect, then I use the ExpoDisk.  Even at 77mm (the size of my largest lens so that it will fit all my other lenses) it's small enough to carry around in my pocket.  I don't know if I'm dorky enough to put it on my belt.The hardest time I had with this was getting the lanyard cord through the hole. The only way I could get that thick cord through the tiny hole was to take a sewing thread to make a loop and pull the lanyard cord through the hole.I've spent thousands of dollars on camera equipment but I've had so many problems getting the color balance correct and this relatively small investment has already saved me a lot of grief.  So perhaps I'm incompetent with Photoshop and gray cards, but this resolves so many of my problems to begin with.I can now shoot in RAW/JPG and directly use the JPGs when I don't need to adjust the exposure. Another time saver.I strongly recommend the ExpoDisk if you're serious about photography and want perfect color balance the first time."",)"

The only issues I had were the networks in between.  The documentation could have been more helpful in the setup, but the continued operation was far more important to me.I like the passive cooling design with no fan to fail.  At least I think they are passive, I have not had any heat problems in more than 3 years of operation.  The SonicWall they were connected two however failed due to heat issues, hence the purchase of another.*** Oct 2013They broke something.I with the last one that I bought there were changes made.  The firmware is different, and it's performance is notably different.  While the device is functional in terms of routing traffic, they user interface is severely broken.  It works fine to get things setup, but once it has been running for a while, you can no longer log in to manage it.  Each time I need to make a change or look at logs, I have to reboot the device.  The UI will then work again for a short period, but eventually return to a broken state.There are also erroneous errors reported in the logs.  Do some googling about this device before you purchase.  It is definitely showing it's age.  I hope someone provides a good alternative soon.  I purchased a SOHO router that seems to be much faster than this and has wireless.  Unfortunately, it lacks some of the features of this router, such as dual WAN (I don't use dual wan and checking forums will show that those who have tried had great difficulty)."",)"
"('October 2006 Update.I\'m about to replace the units: since purchase, I\'ve done 3 firmware updates to resolve various problems, the most recent being intermittent failures when backing up to the DriveStation. Buffalo ultimately concluded the LinkStation should be returned, but they now contend the device is warranted for only one year. At the time of purchase the warranty was two years (as advertised at the time and stated on the registration page of their web site, which I printed). So, given the history of periodic problems and their breach of faith on the warranty, I don\'t recommend Buffalo products.Original Review.First thing you need to do when you get a LinkStation is go to Buffalo\'s web site and get the latest version of the manual. It\'s has more information than what comes on the included CD-ROM, but even then there\'s still lots left uncovered. Strike one star.Installation wasn\'t exactly per the documentation, but easy enough if you know a bit about what you\'re doing. Total set-up time was 10-15 minutes. Map the drive and you\'re ready to go.Performance over WiFi g is only fair. If you\'re thinking of streaming video from this thing think again - 720 x 480 video is choppy.Even so, I liked it well enough that I ordered Buffalo\'s 250 GB DriveStation to attach to the LinkStation. That\'s when the fun began.The documentation for the DriveStation is even sparser than for the LinkStation. I tried setting the DriveStation up as a backup drive, but the LinkStation wouldn\'t recognize it.  At the suggestion of Tech Support I updated the firmware, to no avail, then about 10 minutes into the second call the tech had me set a DriveStation switch to ""Manual"" from the default of ""Auto"" (an undocumented feature). That solves the recognition problem, but it also means the LinkStation no longer controls the power-up/down of the DriveStation. Too bad. You also have to format the DriveStation\'s disk, so in total the set-up time was several hours. Drop another star.The news got worse. If you\'re using the DriveStation for backup (as opposed to additional storage) then you can\'t use the LinkStation\'s ""Sleep/WakeUp"" feature. You can set a time for an automatic backup to begin, but you can\'t have the units turn themselves off or on. The embedded backup app isn\'t smart enough to know what\'s been changed and what hasn\'t, so it copies everything on the LinkStation\'s drive to the DriveStation. It takes well over an hour to backup 20 Gb in this mode (that\'s less than 10% of the drive\'s total capacity) . Oh, and you can\'t write files to the LinkStation when a backup is in progress. Hmmm, how about using an intelligent backup app like SmartSync to do scheduled backups to the DriveStation instead of using the LinkStation\'s backup utility? Works fine if you don\'t mind the 1 Gb/hour transfer rate over your wireless network. Drop yet another star.About the only good news with the DriveStation is that I had to call Tech Support three times. Always got an answer within the first three rings (even on Friday night and Saturday) and the folks knew what they were talking about each time, in a dialect I could readily understand - American English. An unexpected experience these days. Add a star.These products have some nice features, but regrettably key features are compromised according to how you decide to use the products. A few changes to some of the embedded utilities and they\'d be first-rate solutions.',)"
"('First, I have to mention a few things - I have a very high fidelity sound system in my car, and have been with Sirius since it became available.  I heard O&A; was available for XM, and I was interested in doing a comparison since they claim ""the best sound quality for satellite radio"".This unit works wonderfully.  I installed the antenna on my roof next to my existing sirius antenna and ran the cables along the window weatherstripping and into my trunk, under the carpet, etc (mind you I tested it first to ensure it worked).  The interface is intuitive, the orange color seems to match the best in my pontiac grand am gt, and it looks good mounted underneath the stereo in that little cubby area.  Feature-wise, this roady2 works great, is easy to use, and switches channels fast (faster than sirius), but...Now for the bad.  I\'m very dissapointed in XM\'s quality.  Compared to sirius, it sounds like MP3s and MUFFLED!  I won\'t hold the roady2 responsible for this, because I\'ve listed to many tuners out there for XM.  Sadly, anyone with good hearing and a high fi system will be dissapointed at the bass response and the highs (lets not leave out the digital artifacts that chime clear in the mid range!).  Sirius is the way to go, and anyone who mentions the fact that XM is cheaper doesn\'t realize that they want you to pay $4+ dollars more a month just to hear it on your computer via the internet.  Add on premium channels and it can start to choke a horse!Once again however, this tuner is very classy, and will I keep XM along with my sirius?  Yes.  I like O&A; on the high voltage channel (extra $2/month), and extra channel options that are between XM and Sirius.  What would be nice in the future is a dual service tuner so people like me could have their cake and eat it too.  I\'ll be putting a full review up on my own personal site soon if you do a search for it.  Hope this helps folks!',)"

"(""While I can't speak for other people who may be buying a Terk XM Direct kit for their brand of stereo, I can speak for those considering buying this device for their Sony. Simply put, it SUCKS! First of all, when having it professionally installed, I was told that I would loose my auxillary input, which is the main reason I originally bought my Sony stereo, so I could plug my ipod and Sirius satellite into it. Now, I was told, I would need to go to Radio shack and get one of those tacky A/B switches and mount it under my dash if I wanted to use the auxillary input. This was unacceptable to me, so I just gave up my aux input and let them install the Terk Sony XM Direct kit.Once the install was complete, the next wave of pain began! The activation process that XM uses completely sucks! They instructed me that I need to leave my car on for a minimum of 30 minutes, and up to 4 hours to receive the activation signal. Of course, this is a problem for someone who drives 10-15 minutes each way to work, and most of my trips are fairly short, so I found myself sitting in my car in a parking lot waiting for the stupid thing to activate, and it never did. 3 or 4 days later, and several phone calls, I finally decided to just leave the keys in my ignition, in the accessory position, and leave my radio on and hope and PRAY that my car does not get stolen. Thank god it didn't, but my XM Radio finally activated. Now this probably doesn't speak for this perticular product, but I just wanted to warn anyone who is getting XM for the first time, make sure you're planning a road trip, or you don't mind sitting in your car!Continuing my list of disapointments came when I realized that EVERY SINGLE TIME I turn my car off, or switch from XM to CD, the stupid Sony unit looses my DSP and EQ selections, I have to press the DSP button and the EQ buttons each time I turn the car on or switch to XM! Who the heck invented this anyway?Lastly, the stupid thing only displays the artist on the display of my radio, and sometimes that doesn't even work. That being said, this is the WORST in dash integration for XM I have ever seen. And to make matters worse, in January of this year XM made a terrible decision to further compress and process the audio, so the audio quality of the XM is MUCH worse then listening to streaming radio on the internet, or even Sirius for that matter. In fact, if you take out all the static, FM SOUNDS BETTER THEN XM. I'm about ready to rip this thing out of my car and just go back to my exteranal Sirius and IPOD units! Oh and one final thing, this thing takes up BOTH the line input and the CD changer, so don't even think about having a CD changer if you're going to use this thing!"",)"

"('I\'ve seen a number of S-Video to Composite (RCA) male adapters with very low product evaluations.  This one is quite the exception, both in quality as well as fast shipping by the vendor.  There\'s not a lot one can evaluate about an adapter plug other than appearance, durability, and quality of signal, but in all three areas this appears to be a top notch product.  Video quality does not appear to have suffered at all, despite going through an adapter after a very long (15 foot) S-Video cable.We had to replace our old DVD/VCR recorder and the new one does not have S-Video input (one of three options as output from my computer video card).  Of course the digital output goes to the computer monitor, and I\'m no longer using the SVGA output.  It was easy to run the long S-Video cable from that output to the DVD/VCR recorder, thus allowing recording from the computer on a few rare occasions that we wanted to do so.  With the length of the S-Video cable, I was already concerned about loss of signal, and was even more concerned about it when I had to put in an adapter.  Simply not a problem.The appearance certainly looks professional, regardless of where it might be made, and there is no hint of anything lacking durability-wise.  So this gets 5-stars - something we only pass out when something tops out with respect to our hopes/expectations of a product.  And the vendor, CablesOnline.com (Atlantic Computer Tech), is tops on this too.  The invoice was professional looking, there was a small insert with a customer service email address and phone number, as well as their direct URL.  They mention that they have over 5,000 items in stock, and also do special cable orders.  Some may see that as just self-promotion, but I found it helpful to know that they have a very large variety of in-stock items - good to know for the future, perhaps.Would I do business with them again either through Amazon or direct if needed?  No question, unlike my local experience with a big-box store I\'ll simply call ""WorstBuy,"" when I tried to get an adapter locally the other night.  They promised me they had the item in stock, and the customer no-service rep said she had one in her hand (that was after seven different attempts to reach ANYone - busy, hung up, no answer, transferred with no pick-up, etc.).  When I got there, it was in fact an S-Video to composite adapter, but the RCA end was female, not male that I very clearly specified and asked for verification.  They don\'t even carry the male RCA S-Video adapter!  Their fix?  Buy a composite video cable with two male plugs and put yet another patch in the line, plus the added expense of a cable I didn\'t want or need (typical of almost every experience I\'ve ever had at ""WorstBuy"").  In short, it was well worth waiting less than a week to have this plug through Amazon - ordered it on Saturday, had it in our mailbox Thursday.  Considering they wouldn\'t have processed it until Monday, having it arrive through regular USPS delivery just three days later was impressive - and at a reasonable shipping/handling cost.A simple little inexpensive, but necessary adapter plug resulted in a nice buying experience (with nice results minutes after it arrived).  As for ""WorstBuy"" - I very reluctantly went in last Saturday to attempt to get this adapter.  I won\'t waste my time with that place again - they\'re consistently awful.  Amazon comes through once again, with the help of CablesOnline/Atlantic Computer Tech.  (And no, I don\'t have any affiliation with that vendor - hadn\'t even heard of them before last Saturday.)',)"

"(""Let me preface by stating that although I consider myself somewhat knowledgeable in terms of home theater set-up, gear and theory, I am no audio-/videophile and have only been seriously interested in this stuff for a couple of years (and by seriously, I mean able to actually afford it).  I recently upgraded my system with theOnkyo HT-RC180 7.2-Channel Receiveras well as a pair of Paradigm Sutdio 10 bookshelf speakers.  Because I live in an apartment, I initially decided against a subwoofer.  However, after watching a few movies, I realized that despite the excellent bass extension offered by the Paradigms, a subwoofer would be necessary for satisfactory enjoyment.Sound ImpressionsI first attached the Polk to the LFE out on my Onkyo with a standard subwoofer cable.  You will get a few more db's of volume by using a Y-splitter RCA cable, but the sound quality will be identical whichever method you choose.  I set the crossover all the way up on the sub to avoid any chance of interference with the work of the receiver and set the volume to about one fourth of way around the dial.  I ran the Audyssey calibration through the Onkyo and decided to pop Iron Man on Bluray into my PS3. I was shocked that I had to actually turn the bass DOWN, figuring it would be relatively weak at such a low volume setting.  Now again, I do live in an apartment and am considerate of my neighbors.  It was about 10PM when I first tried this puppy out, so I turned it almost all the way down and decided to test another day.  For small rooms, there is no doubt that this subwoofer is plenty capable.  I hate boomy, unrefined bass and was very surprised at how controlled the PSW10 is considering the barely-entry-level price.  I will admit I have not tried using this with stereo music as I feel my Paradigms adeptly handle my genre selections (mostly classical and film scores), but it is likely that music will make any deficiencies more evident.  There is some port noise if you crank it, but ideally listeners should not be aware of a subwoofer in an AV system, rather it should blend with the satellites.  Thus, if you are hearing port noise, the sub is turned up louder than it should be for optimal listening.Build QualityAbsolutely superb.  I would be happy if a $300-400 subwoofer looked and felt so good.DesignI ordered the Cherry model and really appreciate the nice finish.  I do not, however, like the faux aluminum (i.e. painted plastic) cover on the front.  The shiny silver woofer looks very cool, but I very rarely like painted plastic intended to look like metal on anything, so I keep the nice mesh cover in place.I could offer a more detailed review, but why bother?  For $100, there are no worthy competitors.  At this price point, even $25 is a significant step up and you will not do any better without spending considerably more than that.  Pick your color and click the order button."",)"
"('Based on all the great reviews I was expecting a bit more from this Sub.  I have 2 Polk Monitor 60\'s for front, CS1 Center, and Monitor 30\'s for surrounds.  My Monitor 60\'s go head to head with this sub and have better characteristics on all but the lowest frequencies that this sub handles.  While the unit is taking some of the load from my speakers you would be better served going with a higher quality sub based on my own music and movie tests. The good news is the sub does perform well overall but will not give the cleanest sounding bass response.  For movies it does add some punch but for music I found its characteristics particularly lacking.  I started with my sub at 1/3 and adjusted up to half volume and then calibrated my system.  I did not want to overpower the sub and have the bass sound become too boomy.  Unfortunately even at these modest settings the PSW10 while sounding good does not add much additional range as my front Channels can hit 38Hz.  I tried the THX standard of 80Hz crossover to relive my towers from having to hit the lower frequencies.  All in All for the price its not bad, but if you can afford it I would recommend stepping up to the PSW-505 or a similar 12"" Sub that has a bit more range.From the research I\'ve done if you want an ultra high quality sub for music the SVS SB 1000 series is an outstanding value but runs about 500$.  If you have smaller speakers and need this to fill out the low end it should do the job very well to enhance any sat speaker system on a budget.  The PSW10 is still a good value but for my purposes it just didn\'t add much to my setup.  I tested using many types of music and most sounded good, however anything with low frequencies just didn\'t sound as clean as I like.  For the price I paid I will keep the unit and eventually upgrade and use this to add the lower end to my other TV.  Outstanding value overall for a basic sub to add some thump to movies but in my opinion just doesn\'t have the range to add depth when paired with good tower speakers, your mileage may vary and with some adjusting it can sound acceptable for part of the range it handles.  It will miss some of the really low range that you may want for HT use.  In my tests sound of the low end spectrum did vary, for anything with ultra deep frequencies it was muddied and if you put it even at 50% volume you will get port noise(Polk recommended to set between 12 and 2)\\ on the volume) but that was too much in my tests and created really boomy and poor sound.  For anything in moderately deep areas it did well enough to add some depth but will certainly not compete with a sub 3X its price which in reality no one should expect it to.  You get what you pay for holds true for this sub despite all the great reviews, good value as an entry SW but don\'t expect this unit to bring out subtle characteristics in music.  If your expectations are right you should be happy with the value it brings.  I have already ordered the Dayton Sub-1200 to replace this unit as it just doesn\'t work well for my tower speakers, also setting the towers to 60Hz really filled out the sound effects in my room.  They can hit down to 38Hz but not cleanly so I adjusted to keep the sound as level as possible so my frequency response is good. I will update this review with additional information once I have the Dayton 12"" fully calibrated and tested which from what I read competes with well with the PSW505 which is double the price.Update: After dropping sub back to 1/3 power it blends well with my tower speakers for movie watching.  I tested using action intense movies including helicopter flyby\'s in Transformers and it worked well for this.  I also have a large room approximately 20X17 with vaulted ceilings and the kitchen and second floor is also open to this room.  The sub fills the sound stage in the whole family room with only one slight dead spot which is impressive considering my room is so open.  I do recommend for HT movie watching but cant give a good rating for music.  If movies are 90% of what you use it for then this sub is a bargain for what it does.  Keep in mind though there are a few other subs also rated with slightly better range in this price category including the Dayton sub-1000 and sub-1200.  Some reviewers of the Sub1200 are saying its comparable to the Polk PSW505 which if its even close to that it is a steal.  Any louder then 1/3 volume on the PSW10 for me causes the sub to be boomy and not blend, so if your looking for just a descent boost without needing earth trembling bass its a good price and matches well with Polk speakers.  For me based on my research the only subs I would consider at this price point would be the PSW10 and the Dayton Sub-1000/Sub-1200.  After that price jumps up quite a bit for the performance gains. Excellent value overall but 3stars for music for me and 4 for HT use as long as you keep the volume low for clean output.**Final update: Well the Dayton Sub-1200 kicks the crud out of the PSW10, clean even at loud levels and is just overall richer and better in low frequency response.  I\'m actually sorry I bought the Polk before finding out about the Dayton, it does not have the port noise issue in my tests and sounds much better for music as well  I hooked the Polk up to one of my TV\'s and it sounds even worse then before because its not using the sub out.  I have to keep it at very low volume.  I would return it but its not worth it due to shipping costs.  I believe Polk missed the ball as the port noise is a big issue, the other thing about the Dayton is you can crank it up and it doesn\'t hurt your ears, the bass sounds accurate not boomy and painful.  My wife complained about the Polk, the bass was not natural and clean like the Sub-1200 which really extends the range of my speakers and hits all the way down to 25Hz.  Really to my the Dayton is the one to get as its the same price and is just so much more woofer for your money.  Some may actually favor the un-natural boominess of the Polk but not me!',)"

"('Note: Another update to my original review, which says in summation: glad I bought it, love it, expect to use it for years, but recommend you get the Cx instead as the proper map software for this (City Select) is no longer being updated or sold by Garmin for the United States.---------------------I\'m an outdoor guy, and an international traveler; hiked up Mayan pyramids, chased monkeys away from my tent in Asia; and eaten stuff I had no idea what it was as I was saying ""yummy"" in any one of many languages.  Besides all that, I\'m really into maps though never seem to be able to \'find myself\' when I\'ve wandered tens of miles into that mythical \'nowhere.\'  And you know how they say \'you can\'t step in the same river twice,\' well, it turns out you have to at least be able to find the river again before you give it a try--because I would like to try and sleep in the same bed at the end of the day.So I\'ve been wanting one of these things for years, back when the top of the line handheld GPS was the plain eTrex Vista--and it stood alone.  Now of course, you have a multitude of choices, but wouldn\'t go wrong buying this one.Not only does it track your movements and plot routes right out of the box--highways and exits--providing valuable guidance to the edge of nowhere, but once you are nowhere, it can tell you how to get back--and then back to nowhere again.  Add your own tracks and points of interest.Is it bad that it can\'t provide every last detail of an area?  Well, for over $100 a map, yes, but this isn\'t a review of the maps.  This little GPS unit is feature filled.  The maps need to get cheaper, more creative in their variety, but you couldn\'t squeeze anymore functionality into the unit. [added 2/\'07: City Select for the US, which is really the only appropriate map CD to buy for this unit, is no longer being published, so it\'s better to get the Legend Cx, which is exactly the same except for the ability to use SD memory cards--like that used in digital cameras and PDAs these days).Do you really need every last detail of every inch of the state of California loaded when you\'re going to take the highway a hundred miles without stopping? No, of course not.  Do you need to be able to mark a waypoint showing you where that awesome mom-and-pop bar-b-que joint was three years later?  Absolutely.  And you can load multiple maps into it, switching from one to the other as needed [so long as you can find a copy of US City Select].There\'s so much this thing does.  In fact, I\'m going to go play with it right now--if I can only remember where I left it.-------------Just to add to my original review (today being 3/30/2006): I still haven\'t bothered buying any additional map software (I will eventually), and have been adding waypoints myself by either marking them when I\'m there or using Google Earth (which is free on the internet) to find the location and coordinates, then input them into the Waypoints Manager software the GPS comes with, and download them into the GPS (or just enter them directly).  I can also use a free bit of software called ""SportTracks"" to save my tracks throughout the year, and superimpose my travels on to sattelite images (Google Earth again).  This has been working out just great for me.Even in an automobile, it will give me major road, highway, and exit guidance, and when I\'m off course or choose a different way than recommended, it recalculates the course much faster than other units I\'ve tried (such as in rental cars).  Off-road navigation shows me the direction my destination is in versus where I\'m heading, and will also tell me exactly how much time it will take me to get there at my present speed (including stops and such) and what my Estimated Arrival Time is (so I tell the wife, ""I\'ll be there at 7:01pm,"" and I actually am right on the nose!I\'m highly pleased with this purchase, as is, and can only imagine it will serve me 1000 times better once I add more map details.--------------------------BOTTOM LINE including all added comments above: As an avid outdoor guy, principly cyclist, this is still a fantastic item if you can get it for well under $200 (I paid $190 when they were still making it).  Used with free software such as SportTracks and Google Earth (available for download on the internet) it\'s a great item for documenting and mapping your trips, favorite spots and trails, and events like bike tours and adventure races.Even without adding maps, I\'d say it has been worth every penny I paid, and I\'m glad I have it.  On the other hand, I would have waited and bought the Legend Cx if I had known Garmin were going to stop producing the City Select CDs.Without the CDs, you might as well get a Forerunner.',)"

"('My purchasing decision for the Canon Powershot A85 was most unusual. As a defense contractor (and \'part time\' professional photog) and the owner of a Canon Digital Rebel - there are places and circumstances a large digital camera will cause unwanted and undue attention to be paid to one\'s self. My solution was a compact backup camera - originally a Canon A75 - purchased for its price and ability to share compact flash memory cards with the Digital Rebel and AA Ni-Mh rechargable batteries with my Canon 420EX speedlight. Things got more complicated when I purchased a Canon underwater housing (WP-DC30 - see my review) specifically designed for the A75 while scuba diving in Aruba. Both the A75 and A85 are limited underwater performers - built in flash limits the depth acceptable pictures can be taken. Anything more than 25\' - plan to spend time in photoshop!While the A75 is a ""good enough"" camera at 3.2 MP, I was looking to upgrade to a better backup camera - still at a price point - and distrustful of any underwater housing - a replacement backup camera. Amazon had a great price on the A85 - and the underwater housing for the A75 is an exact match for the A85. Enough said.The A85 is lighter and has faster shutter response than the A75. The ""feel"" of this compact camera is ""right"" for my (large) hands. It takes astoundingly beautiful daylight pictures. Its 3x optical zoom is ""good enough"" for a majority of my picture taking - the 4 MP resolution allows additional enlargement and magnification with little loss of quality in Photoshop. Since many of my photo\'s are e-mailed to my family to prove I\'m still alive when on assignment - large picture quality is less important - as most pictures are reduced in size for computer/internet transmission.Auto focus and auto exposure in low light is still slower than I want it to be. Faster than the A75 - but still has an annoying delay setting up flash and auto exposure in low light.As with the A75, the movie mode is limited. No ability to zoom - and quality is only \'acceptable\' in this mode. Like to take movies?... - buy a camcorder!Red-eye is still a problem carried over from the A75. The flash/lens positioning allows only a narrow angle of red-eye free picture taking.You are going to have to purchase 2300ah NiMh rechargable batteries - or even two sets. I share 5 sets and three chargers (might be overkill for some) with my Canon 420EX and 580EX speedlights (used with the Digital Rebel), the A75 and A85 cameras. High heat or extreme cold are battery power sappers. Never want to miss a picture opportunity. I also share a variety of 512MB to 1 GB compact flash high speed memory cards with the Digital Rebel.The A75\'s plastic case easily scratches around the lens ring. I expect this with the A85 also. Buy a carry pouch that holds the camera firmly - and still has carrying capacity for a spare set of AA batteries. Dirt and dust have not been a problem - yet - although the camera case and lens mechanism need to be either vacuumed or airblown to keep sand and grit from interfering with the zoom mechanism. Sand and grit get into everything in many places I go.Under most circumstances - the A85 performs brilliantly. Under water (limited by its\' flash) - or above - anywhere a full sized camera presents a problem - the A85 gets the job done.',)"
"('I\'ve had this camera for almost a year now. I\'ve taken over 3000 pics with it and am very very happy with the results. I got it when it was $100 more than it streets for now, and still think it\'s a great deal.LOWDOWN: If you\'re like me and would rather concentrate on enjoying the moment, yet be able to take pretty darn good shots when you want to without lugging all that equipment around for an SLR/DSLR, then this is the cam for you. The A95 has that important balance between pocketability, fit-to-hand, weight, and great optics and sensor.Plainly put, i find that I have the cam with me when the opportunity presents itself, whether it\'s a great moment or planned shot. So I take the picture, instead of wishing i had lugged all the equip around. I just do some exposure bracketing just in case, and I\'m good to go. The controls are easy, and for anyone going from 35mm SLR to this, the controls are there for you to make sure that you take a good shot. Aperture priority, shutter priority, ASA film settings, etc..For the lazy snapshooters inside of all of us, there are enough quick settings to use that you can pretty much be guaranteed a good photo as long as you use a little intelligence.But what about the pictures? Folks compliment me all the time on my shots, and ask about my SLR. There are about 30 photos posted on my office wall (use a real silver halide service and skip the crappy home printers). These are anything from 5 x 7 to framed 22"" x 30"" posters. They all look pretty damn good because of 5MP plsu smart ASICs that Canon has (plus the ability to edit them easily when needed with Photoshop Elements.)I don\'t bother with the share functions, just pop the compact flash in my card reader and Elements just sucks it right in - simple.Great sensor that can simulate up to 800ASA film (maybe faster), i think, so under most circumstances, with subjects that are not moving much, it works great. And the Scene settings work well. You should see the great Fireworks shots i got this weekend. BTW - maybe I\'m not discriminating enough, but i haven\'t conticed a big \'purple fringing\' problem.This is my third DSC - had a Fuji 900 - great cam, takes better pics than my Olympus, but too big to slip into pocket; Olympus c70(?) camedia - nice lens, but needs image stabilization to take advantage of the ling lens. Not great images - lots of noise at low light settings.This review would be five stars if not for the programming of the flash (need a slower, softer flash, or a hot shoe that i can control). The flash, when used in less than 8\' from the subject, has a tendancy to blow out the details. So I shoot with natural light whenever I can. And of course, i would love if the A95 had the responsiveness and no shutter lag like a DSLR - but for hundreds less, it\'s quick enough.The A95 will probably remain my main camera for some time. I may even skip plans for getting a DSLR, instead I\'m ordering the A95 accessory lenses, so i may never need a DSLR....p.s. Make sure to get a couple or three of 512MB cards - they\'re cheap enough now, and if you use the top resolution setting, you\'ll find that a card fills up on a weekend trip.',)"
"(""The A95 is an EXCELLENT follow up to the A80, and offers some very nice improvements.  The most noticeable is the jump to 5 megapixels at $100 lower MSRP than the A80 when it came out!  Then there is the larger rotating LCD that is now useable in low light, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc.  There is also the addition of the Flexi-Zone feature, which lets you choose one of the 9 autofocus spots, so you can focus on non-centered objects!  This is usually a feature only found on much higher priced cameras.  The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery like a city-scape.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.  One other plus is the flip-out rotating LCD screen, which is VERY useful when your camera is on a tripod, is low to the ground, or when the camera is pointed up but below shoulder height, because you can simply flip the LCD screen to the proper viewing position instead of getting down behind the camera.  You can also use it to shoot over peoples' heads and use it to get a preview when you are doing self portraits.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you are looking to spend much less but want to get pretty much the same camera at 4 megapixels, check out the Canon Powershot A85 or the 3 megapixel A75.  you lose the rotating LCD though."",)"

"(""I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.  It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.  I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.  I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.  It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.  The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.  It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.  I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library for upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).  I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.  It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.  This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.  Way to go Apple!  You've earned a new fan."",)"
"(""You know that FreeiPods site everyone bugs you to join?  I did, and successfully got a FREE ipod through it.

I have just about my entire CD collection fit onto it, and you know what percent I am at towards the capacity limit?  ONE PERCENT.  It really is mind boggeling that I could add 10 of my friends CD collections on here in addition to my own and it STILL wouldn't be filled.  The sound quality is amazing, but keep in mind the sound is only going to be as good as your files are.  If you illegally download crappy 92kb files, they are going to replay as crappy 92kb files.  Songs that you purchase and import from iTunes sound outstanding, rich and full.The headphones that came along with it look pretty dinky, but once you get used to the fit of them in your ears, they sound out of this world for being included in the package.I think the feature I love the most is that I am able to plug in my Harman Kardon Soundstick computer speakers into the top of the iPod and listen to it just like I would be listening to a standalone CD Stereo System without having to have the computer on.  My entire CD collection is right here at my fingertips.Aside from music storage and playing, I LOVE that I can use this a essentially a portable harddrive.  If you're in college like I am, you have to write papers and etc.  You can drop your files on here from your home computer, go to school and hook it up to a computer there and get the files off of the iPod without having to burn CD's or put them on faulty flash drives or zip discs.This is not only an invaluable item, but really one of the best technological advancements entertainment has seen in the past few years.

I can't deny that I love the thing since getting it as a gift, and I don't really miss lugging around a portable disc player and a CD wallet.The design is slick, to be sure.  This version, the 4th generation, has one simple click-wheel with all the buttons you need.  The device is slim and light, the screen is perfectly fine...although a color screen would be a nicety, it's no show-stopper.For most music fans, the sound is great.  Honestly, unless you're a real audiophile, ripping songs at 160 in AAS format (Apple's format) is prime for this device, and it doesn't disappoint.  Headphones on the other hand, will be up to you.  I don't really like earbuds, so the infamous white iPod buds haven't gotten much use (they're also an invitation to get mugged).  I'd recommend investigating online for the right earphones for you depending on a) your price range (you can spend over $500 if you really want, b) the kind of music you listen to (some folks are pickier than others, and like the heavier bass that an over-the-ear set of cans provides), and c) where you listen to your iPod.  The last one is important because some folks insist on certain noise-reduction headphones, which mean the person next to you on the train won't hear you blasting your favorite Englebert Humperdink tunes.  Some like earbuds while others prefer big-rig headphones for heavy-duty sound.The design is nice, but this thing will be scratched up in about 10 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and buy a protective case or cover.  The various 'skins' out there are very nice indeed, like the iSkin, though other brands make similar items for less.  It's basically a simple silicone or rubber 'skin' that fits tightly right over the iPod, and plastic protective covers slip right over the screen and the click-wheel, meaning they won't get scratched to heck.  Not only that...but the slick white iPod is damn slippery, and with no case, I wouldn't trust this thing to survive a single tumble.It's easy to use...it will probably take you about 5 minutes to figure the whole thing out.  Even transferring music is relatively painless, it's just time-consuming if you source from CDs, but well worth it.The capacity is very nice--20 GB is a lot of music, and you won't realize it for real until you start putting tunes on here.  If you've got most of your stuff on a hard drive already, you'll be tempted to just throw everthing onto the 'Pod, likely filling it up in a jiffy.  If you have a million CDs, you'll be more careful about what you store on here, and perhaps for the better.  Honestly, do you need every single CD single you ever bought on here?  Or that obscure soundtrack album you haven't listened to in seven years?  If you've got discs, hold on to 'em, as they are the source media.Otherwise, I have to say I wish the battery life were longer on this.  I don't care what Apple says, the battery life is a lot less than advertised.  Ask anyone who owns one.  But treat it like a cell phone--charge it every day when you get home, you'll be fine.Also, Apple may claim 5,000 songs...but that's if you rip everything at lousy quality.  Go to 160, you'll get more than enough tunes on here.  Don't obsess over the hard drive space, unless you wanna put every single item of music you ever bought on here and then sort and categorize them...you might think twice and be more realistic.All in all, even with that price tag, this is a very nice, practical item that folks will love.  Makes an awesome gift for any music lover (basically anyone).  Whether or not you use iTunes, this thing will be very handy.Yes, now you can become one of 'Them', the legions of iPod people on the streets.  There's a reason it's out there, everywhere--it's a well-designed, practical product.Of course, it's up to you when to go with the new, or to upgrade.  No doubt we'll see a new iPod every 8 months to a year, but this thing isn't going anywhere for a while.  It's got music, it sounds good.  Whether or not you need your photos, phone, blackberry, contacts, coffee maker, and brain tumor all in one device now or later is up to you."",)"

"('I still drive an \'89 Cougar, which came with a JBL Premium sound ""package."" (Premium JBL speakers and subwoofer, built-in CD player, cassette player and AM/FM radio.)After 10-12 years, the CD player died, after that, the rear-deck subwoofer died (which I removed shortly afterword,) and about a year ago, the right channel output died as well.I bought the Bazooka to replace the JBL unit, thinking it would be a fairly straight-forward process. In actuality it is, but I didn\'t know that at first. If you\'re like me, and haven\'t worked on anything like this for a while, you might want to read up on current car-stereo technology. (Although I couldn\'t find a decent explanation of the following...ANYWHERE!!!!)I know I will be laughed at for this, but I couldn\'t figure out what that extra POWER CONNECTION wire was for, or how it operated, and I had one heck of a time getting any information about it at all. It\'s described as a trigger wire of some sort, but that didn\'t give me enough detail, so I remained ignorant for quite some time. (Why would I need TWO 12-volt DC power connections to the Bazooka??????)That ""extra"" POWER CONNECTION is nothing more than another 12-volt DC connection that delivers power ONLY to a relay switch INSIDE the Bazooka. (That relay then connects the MAIN 12volts power line to the internal amplifier)The part I didn\'t get was that the extra ""trigger wire"" ONLY provides that power when you turn your ignition key on, OR when you turn your stereo head-unit on, OR when your power antenna is energized. These options all depend on your existing equipment, and how you decide to wire everything up. Most modern head-units have a DC power wire to connect this ""trigger wire"" to, and if not, you can use the antenna connection, or a connection at your ignition switch or fuse-box.Another detail that nobody under the sun would explain to me, is that this extra wire CONTINUES to deliver 12volts to the internal relay for as long as your ignition is on, or your radio is on, or your antenna is energized. (Again, depending on how you hook things up.) That extra 12volts, holds the Bazooka\'s internal power-relay closed, to allow the MAIN 12volts from the battery to drive the Bazooka\'s internal amplifier.Again, my first instinct was to question why I would need two supplies of continuous 12volts DC. It just didn\'t make sense to me. I now know, that when the relay power is off, the main connection goes off as well, making sure that you don\'t drain your battery when the unit is not in use.NOTE; The Bazooka also comes with an auto-on feature which will turn on the main power when there is an audio signal through the audio inputs. I haven\'t tried this, as I read a few complaints that the connection was too intermittent. I prefer a much more positive method for providing main amplifier power.Other than all that confusion, I DID get to temp-test the Bazooka (mounted in my trunk,) with my crippled JBL head-unit, and it worked perfectly. (Better than the original JBL subwoofer I\'d say, and with considerably more power.) The only issue I had was some thumping as I used my brakes etc., but that should be fixed when I run the main power connection directly from the battery wire. I also bought a new Pioneer head-unit from Amazon, and I\'m still in the middle of the installation. When I finish, I will edit this review and give some more information about the Bazooka. I\'ve been a highly placed professional in the audio business for multiple decades, so I hope that some will find my opinion useful.',)"
"('EVALUATIONThis is a full-size monopod--not a gorilla of a monopod, but full-size. Ironically the very same monopod is sold under different brandnames as a ""light weight"", as a ""heavy duty"", and as a ""professional"" monopod--it is NONE of these.  Given that it is actually an average weight (at best), light-duty, amateur monopod, it is an excellent design, and a very good value.The monopod is NOT ""professional grade"", meaning that it probably will NOT stand up to abuse, and/or constant use, and/or a heavy camera with a 1000mm lens.  Nevertheless a careful pro who occasional uses a monopod for a small to medium-size camera (or is careful to balance larger loads) would probably be very pleased with it.  It does everything a monopod should do, and does those things well.  It operates quickly and easily, and is very sturdy, proving solid support.  Read the 1-star reviews carefully, but take them ""with a grain of salt.""IDENTICAL MONOPODS WITH OTHER BRANDNAMES (may be cheaper)Except for a green case, the Opteka is absolutely identical to the DolicaWT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod.  Except for a very slightly different grip, the Dolica is absolutely identical with theVivitar VIV-VT-67 67-Inch Monopodor the AmazonBasicsAmazonBasics 67-Inch Monopod. Exactly the same monopod is sold under the ""Digital Pro"" brandname.VITAL STATISTICS>Length: 21 "" long fully-collapsed; 67"" tall fully extended>Diameter: uppermost section is 1"";  foam grip 1 3/8""; strap ferrule 1 "">Weight: 14 oz; case 3 oz; total 17 ozFEATURES>Maximum Height: 67"", more than tall enough for most purposes.>Minimum Height: 21"", 23--24"" with a (virtually required) ballhead/tilt-head is a little tall for some closeup nature subjects.>Head (camera threads, etc.): The design is odd, with an free-wheeling plastic collar around a small metal stem (and camera threads), the collar is free-wheeling so that it will not scratch the base of your camera--but you still have to rotate the monopod or your camera to screw them together, or apart. (A few confused reviewers thought that they could just turn the collar to attach/detach the camera, and when that didn\'t work, they thought it was broken.  Turning the collar doesn\'t do anything, that\'s just the way it is).  Reportedly the metal stem breaks off if you put it under alot of strain (such as a heavy camera).  Then, because the attached collar is free-wheeling, it is very difficult to remove the stem from your camera.  If that happens, I suspect that you could glue the collar to the stem with a little crazy-glue and then easily unscrew it from your camara.  The problem is best avoided by simply NOT attaching your camera directly to the monopod.  Instead always used a ""quick connect"", a tilt head, or a ball head (see below).>Lanyard: adequate for hanging the monopod from a hook, but too weak to rely on for as a walking stick hand strap.>Grip:  Foam rubber, provides good grip and cushion.>Body: Channels prevent rotation.>Thumb locks: Operate quickly and smoothly, and lock securely---actually just a tad too easily. I fear that with a little wear, that the locks will slip.  Unlike the less convenient ""twist to lock"" design (used on many other monopods/tripods), you can\'t just ""twist harder""---there is nothing you can do if the lock doesn\'t hold.  Honestly, I am torn about applying a little silicon grease to the locks to minimize wear, and the concern that the grease might encourage slipping.  If you get one with tight leg locks, the silicon grease is highly recommended, it will both make the action smoother and protect against wear---lightly apply to the levers where they rub against the monopod column.Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.Note that unlike petroleum grease, silicon grease does not damage plastic or attract dirt.>Tip:  Metal tip for hard surfaces; plastic tip screws out over metal tip for indoor surfaces.  Neither tip can come loose and get lost.  The metal tip is not particularly sharp, and the plastic tip is not soft.  That is, the metal tip might slip on smooth rocks, and while the plastic tip will protect most indoor surfaces from scratches, it does little to protect your camera from the jarring of impacts (which is VERY bad for cameras).  Therefore it is best NOT to leave your camera on your monopod if you use the monopod as a walking stick.  A ""quick connect"" such asSima Quick Connect for Tripodcan be handy.>Case:  Rugged, attractive green nylon with black trim, with full-length zipper and an adjustable shoulder strap.  Unfortunately the case will not close with a ball head attached.  The usual plastic fittings will not rust, but can be broken by abusive use.AS A TRAVEL MONOPODAt 21"" collapsed the monopod is too large to fit in most airplane carry-on luggage.  Airport security will probably confiscate it if found.  17oz is on the heavy side for travel.  For travel, I use a very similarNorazza Monopod-lightweight TD140, which collapses to 15 "" x "" diameter, weighs only 7oz, but is too short (52"") for birding and some other situations.AS A TRAVEL MONOPOD / WALKING STICK / HIKING POLEA proper hiking pole needs a substantial strap, so that you do not have to have a death-grip on the grip for hours at a time.  The supplied lanyard is inadequate for this purpose and cannot be replaced with a more substantial strap.  However, if use a ballhead, you can install the end of a replacement strap beneath the ball head.  I have not found replacement straps for sale---but you can make one from a 12"" length of 1"" black nylon webbing you probably have lying around form old equipment---use a soldering gun to cauterize a ~1/4"" hole in the webbing.  For travel, when I will be hiking, I use aStansport Outdoorsman Trekking Polewhich has camera threads (and therefore can be used as a monopod), and has a very sharp metal tip for gripping ice or rocks and a very shock absorbing rubber tip for indoor surfaces (but I use the rubber tip outdoors to protect my camera from jarring).ESSENTIAL ACCESSORYMANY reviewers report that the head (where your camera screws onto the monopod) can break off attached to your camera, and then can be very difficult to remove from your camera.  The best insurance against damage to your camera is to use a ball-head or tilt head, which I consider essential anyway (or a ""quick connect"" see above).  For example,Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mountwhich is adequate for small to medium-size cameras.  Unfortunately the monopod will not fit in the case with the ball-head attached.  The silicon grease I mentioned earlier will also make the action of a ball head smoother---usually only a concern shooting video on a tripod, but it\'s worth knowing.  But keep the silicon very far from your lens---it may be very difficult to remove.BALL HEAD OR TILTHEADFor video, when you will never take verticals---a tilt head is by far the best solution, the limited motion is more controllable.Manfrotto 234 Monopod Tilt Head (Replaces 3232)But for stills, when you may want to take an occasional vertical, a ball-head is preferred.  A compound tripod head offers both options, but requires at least three hands, one to hold the monopod, one (or two) to operate the head, and one for your camera---in contrast, you can hold the monopod and operate a ball-head or tilt-head with one hand.',)"
"(""First, allow me to give a brief history on my owned camers. The first good camera I bought was a Minolta Maxxum 7000 back in the mid 80's. This was a good camera and I took many pictures over the years. The first digital I bought was the 3MP Olympus C3000 in 2001. In mid 2004, the camera bit the dust (unfixable). Luckily, I had an extended warranty and the retailer allowed me to choose another camera which cost the same as the Olympus. The only one they had in stock which suited me at the time was Kodak's DX7590. I kept the camera for a couple of months and even though it took good pictures, something just wasn't right. The detail was lacking, shots were not consistent and white balance was off at times. Even though it was a little faster than the Oly, still something was missing. Since it was a replacement, and I was ready to upgrade anyhow, selling it outright would not be a loss to me.I wanted a good camera in the $500 range, at least 5MP and a powerful zoom. I researched and researched, and everything seem to lead me back to the Panasonic FZ20 time and time again. I was nervous about complaints on some noise, dim LCD and battery life.  I ordered the FZ20 and I must say I made a good decision. Maybe I've had bad apples in the past and didn't know a good digital when I saw one, but the Panasonic far exceeds my expectations.It is quick to focus (even in a dim lit room). The zoom is fast and awesome. The histogram is a nice feature. The noise is not detectable for 99% of the shots, and probably 100% of the shots for most users. The flash has a very good range, as well. It reminds me a lot of my Maxxum 7000 in the feel, functionality, and operation. I took and compared similar pictures with the Kodak and found that the Kodak was richer in color, but the Panasonic was clearer. However, the Panasonic has settings which increased saturation. As far as the the LCD brightness, I'm not sure where those complaints come from. It's bright enough for me. It does dim a little when you press the shutter, but that is no concern to me at that point.If you are looking for a simple, no thrills, point and shoot camera, the Panasonic may not be for you. Don't get me wrong, the panasonic produces good pictures by pointing and shooting, but you have much more control over varying situations if you need that control. I think it is more of a professional camera than the Kodak and Oly, which I previously owned.Not sure on what color to get? Silver or Black. That was a hard decision for me, but I recommend the black. It's sharp looking, and any lens accessories you buy will probably be black, too. I've heard that when silver finishes wear they show black. That was enoght to turn me against the silver.So, if you are looking for a 5MP range, long zoom, professional feel and operation type camera, which takes excellent pictures, look no further. I think the Panasonic DMC-FZ20 will make you happy.Update: After two months of use, I like this camera even more. I always display the most recent pictures as a slideshow screensaver (full screen) on our PC. Looking over the Christmas pictures, I am intrigued by the clarity, color richness, and natural look given by these photographs. I've also purchased a lens tube adapter (Raynox RT5264P) and attached a 52mm UV filter. If you want your camera to look even sharper, get the lens adapter. The lens hood which comes with the camera is nice to have gotten, but it is mainly for bright light situations, and  the thread size is like 72mm. The hood is good for wide angle, but zoom shots have a decreased angle of view, can can cause flare and ghost images. [...]"",)"
"('Okay, suddenly finding myself sliding over the ""old-guy"" milestone, I don\'t really use expressions like ""Rocking"" or ""Rocks"" and so on.  But I gotta\' say that this camera is everything and then some for a digital hobbyist with pretensions to artistry such as myself.  I have owned several $50-100.00 digicams in the vga-to-1.5 mp range; and also an Olympus C-211 2mp, Fujifilm F-2400Zoom, and another fuji 2mp digital camera. After learning how to coax some nice pix out of these digicams  I began lusting after megapixels and zoom.After doing what I thought was much research on the web I settled on the minolta z-3 and the Lumix DMC-FZ20K.  I bought the z-3.  Wonderfully ergonomic in the hand, the picture-taking was dissapointing.  After doing more research I discovered that it was possible to take good pix with it with some tinkering, but not, generally, with the ""auto"" settings.Not what I had in mind.Sending it back after two weeks of puttering about with it, I bought the FZ20K.YESSSS!!!!I was taking fabulous pix right out the box, and even shifting exposure settings and such to realize special effects and so on.  The camera is bulkier than the minolta, but I find it more intuitive and I don\'t have to putz around with the controls to get good snapshots.  Along with the 12x optical zoom on the Leica lens, the ability to capture great shots with all the special scene modes, and video with sound, I have to say that this is the 5 mp digital camera to have, hands down!NOTE:I bought a three-piece filter kit and adapter tube along with this camera from A& M photo world (amphotoworld.com - ask for Tyler), a couple of extra battery packs from thomasdistributing.com, 3 ATP 512mb SD cards (60x), a universal ac adapter, a full-size and a desktop tripod, and a camera bag from microcenter, and I am now looking forward to capturing some good pix on our vacation in Hawaii.Total price of this package:  around $750.00 with taxes and shipping included and well worth it.',)"

"('I\'ve had these speakers for about six weeks and I think they have a great sound.  I have them hooked up to a new Alienware system with a SoundBlaster X-Fi card.  I use the card for both gaming and music.  The system is located in a 11\' x 11\' home office with the speakers located at each corner of 5\' desk and the subwoofer in front of the desk.I have switched from a 5.1 system I got with my previous Alienware system.  I\'m in my 50\'s and have seen about every sound gimmick come down the pike.  There are a lot of people who love 5.1 and have time to tweak them, I\'m just not one of them.  I\'ve had the 5.1 system for about five years hooked to a SoundBlaster Live card.  I\'m pretty adept with computers, so I have kept up with the drivers, played with the balance, moved the speakers and done about everything I can to ""feel"" the game.  I usually play Call of Duty or Far Cry type games.  I also play RTS games of the C&C; stripe.I must be getting old, because I\'m tired of screwing around with sound systems.  I\'m at a point where I just want to sit down and hear some great sound without going through all of the situational adjustments (FPS game, music, RTS game, SAT TV, etc).  If you just want something that has great fidelity and some oomph in the low range, this is your system.What I like:1.  The sound for music is fantastic.  I have eclectic tastes in music and all of it sounds great across the board with excellent fidelity.  Some songs you can hear every instrument and note.  It\'s as good as the source (mp3, wma, etc) can make it.2.  The stereo effect is wonderful.  It\'s like having a center speaker without having the clutter of a physical speaker on your desk, plus you still get a great sense of left/right effects.3.  The subwoofer will rock you.  I have it front of a solid wood desk and it will shake the desk at half bass.  When I play COD or MOH, it\'s like you are on Omaha beach during an artillery barrage.  It\'s as real as I need it.  I don\'t need 5.1 to hear the shell whistling past me to get a great effect.4.  I really like the control.  It sits well on the desk next to my keyboard.  Nice big dials that index the bass and volume well.  There is good size off switch that is easy to hit if you need to kill the sound quickly without searching for a mute button.  There is also a plug for headphones.  Makes it convenient if you don\'t want to have to keep reaching around the back of the system.  It also has a blue power light which I prefer.5.  Very, very, very easy to set up.  Just plug the speakers into the subwoofer and then plug the system cable into the sound card.  Turn it on.6.  Uses the system software for balance and treble.  It will also use the software equalizer.  You may ask why this is important.  Half my problem with my last set of speakers is that the computer had an equalizer, the installed SoundBlaster software had an equalizer, the player had an equalizer and the speaker system had a equalizer, speaker balance.  Give me a break.  There were four sets of adjustments that you had to manage depending on what you were doing at the time (game, music, TV).  I never knew which control was in control.  My results were mixed at best.  Now I just worry about the computers settings and I get great sound in any of my apps.7.  I have not detected the irritating hum my last system had during quiet times or when no music was playing.8.  I like the style of the speakers.  Silver with black cloth covers.  They seem very substantial.What I don\'t like:1. I may be old fashioned, but I want the option to change the length of my speaker wires.  I don\'t know why Logitech has gone this route, but the speaker wire is permanently affixed to the back of the speaker and terminates with an RCA plug.  I prefer heavy gauge speaker wire and would like the option to move the subwoofer farther away.  This requires me to buy expensive RCA cable as opposed to regular speaker wire.2.  The subwoofer is probably physically bigger than it should be for a small room system.  There is no room for it under the desk (that\'s why it\'s in front of it:).  I\'m still experimenting with placement.  Make no mistake, this puppy is big.  It also has metal heat vanes on the back that give it additional length.  If you are working with limited space, make sure you pay attention to the dimensions.3.  While I like the control, it makes placing the subwoofer across the room somewhat problematic.  The wire from the subwoofer to the controller is a 6\' long thick proprietary cable.  The system sound plug then runs from the controller to the sound card.  The speakers cords run directly to the subwoofer.  This system is meant for close-in.Conclusion:This is a great trouble free set of speakers with great sound.  Just plug and play without a lot of fuss.  I knocked off a star because of the limited flexibility imposed by the cabling scheme.  That being said, I don\'t think you can beat the sound at this price.  To be honest, I have a pretty decent ear and these are as good as any system I have listened to.  I feel my money was well spent and I am most satisfied with my purchase.  So if you are tired of trying to make the latest gimmick work (7.1 THX) and you just want great sound, this is your system.',)"

"('First, a response to the slightly negative review:First, I agree with the recommendation for the 055XproB.  For half the price, you get a great tripod.  Neotec is neat, but gimmicky.  I can set up a normal tripod (like the above mentioned) in just a few more seconds that it takes to pull out the Neotec\'s legs.  The Neotec collapses in about 2 seconds less time, and adjustment time is equal.  So if you\'ve got half the funds, get the 055XproB.  If you\'ve got twice the funds, get carbon fiber ;-).The Neotec is not the most, nor by any means the least stable.  It is heavy and solid, but does have a torque/twist that you don\'t really want.  It\'s not significant for any but the most demanding applications, however.  I don\'t know how the reviewer got ""motion blur"" using ANY camera on ANY tripod in a room with no wind.  Maybe a train was passing by, or the reviewer was walking on a floor plank the tripod was on.  This tripod has some play, but it doesn\'t move of it\'s own will.I have had mine for a year and a half, use it every day in a fairly rough way, and it has no discernible scratches.  I wouldn\'t care if it did.My major gripe is that after a while, the legs get hard to pull out and push in.  The manual says to lubricate them, but doesn\'t say WITH WHAT.  I tried a few different lubricants, but they only lasted a day or two.  I emailed tech support, and they said that the tripod is not user-serviceable, even for lubrication, and that it must be sent in for repair.  I sent a couple emails trying to get them to tell me how to service it myself, but they just kept saying I had to send it in.So I sent it in, and it was fixed for free and returned promptly.  The work order said ""lubricated tripod legs"".  They functioned better, but only for a couple weeks.I am happy to report that I have found a pretty good procedure for maintaining the legs:Every couple weeks (more or less, depending on use and conditions), wipe off the legs and then apply a lubricant.  I use Goo-Gone to clean the legs, wipe it off completely, then use SILICON lubricant (I use dielectric grease) to lubricate.  Just wipe a VERY SMALL amount on, rub it around, and wipe off as much as you can.  Wipe it like you don\'t want any left on there.Now you\'re good for a couple weeks.DO NOT USE WD-40, GRAPHITE, or TEFLON LUBRICANTS!Also, the bubble level will eventually fall off. I put a tiny drop of Gorilla Glue on the edge, and it won\'t be coming off any more.Also, the hex/allen screws at the top of the tripod legs may become loose (one of mine did after a year).  Just pay attention to them, because if they fall out and you can\'t find them, you\'re probably screwed (they ain\'t standard screws).  You can put some of the milder form of loctite on them, or maybe even hairspray, to keep them in.',)"

"('Well I\'ve been using this mouse for about 4 months now and I figured it was time to write a review. My ""mouse history"" over the last few years goes from a \'normal\' mouse, to an optical Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer, then to a wireless MS Intellimouse Explorer, then to this Logitech MX1000. This is BY FAR the best mouse I have owned or used.First, the change from a traditional mouse with a tracking ball on the bottom to an optical mouse was a revolution. Mice became so much more smooth and precise. Then came wireless mice and the convenience of not having to deal with a cord and the freedom that provided in where and how you use your mouse made it difficult to ever go back to a corded mouse. Now comes the laser mouse, and unbelievably, it makes a substantial enhancement on the optical technology. It\'s similar, but better. It\'s surprising how much more accurate and smooth-tracking it is when compared to optical mice. It\'s one of those things that you\'ll just have to experience to really understand.One thing that I wanted in a mouse was a charging station. The wireless Microsoft mouse just went through AAs like candy and so I decided that a charging station setup was a must-have for my next mouse. What I didn\'t expect was how long the batteries on this baby would last between charges. I would say it easily goes a couple of weeks without needing to be charged. I probably only charge it once or twice a month (but I only use it for maybe 15 hours a week because most of my time is spent on my laptop). BUT, I don\'t see why this really matters for most people since it\'s pretty easy to set it on the charging station when you\'re not using it. I don\'t do that because I have the base setup in a rather unconventional place (off the desktop and out of the way, but only a slight hassle for me to get to).Another thing I really like about this mouse is the button configuration. Do you remember what it was like to not have a scroll-wheel on a mouse? That seems like the Dark Ages now. That\'s also how I feel about having only two (or one ;) button on a mouse. The addition of the forward and back buttons near the thumb on the MS mice I owned became indispensable for me. The Logitech adds the application-switching (alt-tab) button between them, the tilt scroll wheel for easier horizontal scrolling, and the \'cruise control\' buttons above and below the scroll wheel.If you can\'t tell, I love this mouse and would buy it again in an instant. I do, however, have some complaints. This has probably been mentioned in previous reviews, but my mouse would skip around quite a bit for no reason at all. I found a lot of information about this problem on the Logitech forums but ultimately just decided to use the PS/2 adapter to connect to my computer instead of a USB port. Problem solved. If you have the software installed, I haven\'t witnessed any loss in functionality in comparison to having it connected via USB, plus, this obviously saves you from having to occupy yet another USB port on your computer. My other complaint is that the wireless signal seems pretty sensitive to interference (more so than the Microsoft wireless) so you may have to experiment with your base placement before you find the ideal setup for your space.This is an excellent mouse with very few drawbacks. If I had made a description of what my perfect mouse would be, this has it all (except that I still have to use my hand to move it :)',)"

"('I used to have Logitech X-230s.  They were good speakers, but they were 2.1s and didn\'t really do an X-Fi XtremeMusic justice.  Therefore, I decided to upgrade.Please note that I am not really a ""hard-core audiophile"" and my ""taste"" in speakers is more in line with the average consumer than the studio mixer or hi-fi nut.Short Pro and Con ListPros- Can you say LOUD AND CLEAR?  No distortion even when I crank the thing to maximum- No hardwiring on satellites.  The wires can easily be extended.  From what I read of some earlier online reviews, the original design had hardwired satellites which meant that if you wanted longer wires, too bad.  Mine does not suffer from that problem.- Good for movies, music and games- Easy-to-read LCD on the control center, which is very easy to use (""Digital SoundTouch"" is what they call it).- Subwoofer with enough power to flatten a buildingCons- The subwoofer on its own weighs in at a massive 40LBS+, the system is thus hard to move- System needs about a week of gentler use before it can sound its best.- Hardwired cable on the back of the control center is ANNOYING and limits where you can place your control deck relative to the sub (which it plugs into)- Only comes with the basic cables for a computer soundcard, even though the system supports digital optical and digital coaxial inputs as wellOverall, a great buy!  If you need speakers for a gaming/media PC look no further.  These speakers are so powerful that anything more than 1/3 power on your average song is a bit unbearable.  There isn\'t much that can touch these for the same or similar price.  The system supports a ""Boost Mode"" that takes it to an earth-shattering 1000 watts of power.  To activate, turn the volume up to full and keep spinning the knob.  It should say ""Boost 1.""  If you keep going, you can go all the way to Boost 22.  However, anything past 12 causes sound distortion, and level 22 WILL damage your speakers.Advice for New Owners (which I got from another owner)1.  Do NOT go for full power right away, as you will most likely damage the speakers!2.  Keep the volume control under half for the first week or so, then move up from there3.  The ""Boost Mode,"" which takes the speakers past the ""maximum"" volume on the control unit, can be dangerous both to the speakers and your hearing!  DO NOT USE in the first week of ownership.4.  Don\'t play with the dial.  Yes, it\'s pretty, but twisting the volume control up and down a lot may blow the fuse on the back of the subwoofer.5.  Don\'t push the sub too hard until you break the system in, either.',)"
"('When I bought my new PC about a year ago I knew that I wanted great sound for my $1200 investment. After a lot of research I decided on the Bose Companion II Series II speakers. They sound great, and despite their high price tag, I was happy.Still, this new high end PC had a 5.1 coax output that was going unused, and in all fairness, the Bose speakers I owned couldn\'t pump out any sound I would consider loud. So I did away with the Bose with the hope of rattling the walls and listening to movies in surround sound. Continuing with my ""go big or not at all"" attitude, I decided on the Logitech Z-5500.First off, this is not a light system. It weighs 55 pounds (probably 50 of that is subwoofer) so this doesn\'t feel like some cheap toy. The UPS guy was happy when I signed off because I would imagine carrying this beast back to the truck would not be ideal in the 100 degree Virginia summer. So, the box is huge, but everything inside is well placed, and easy to figure out.There are 4 identical satellite speakers with swiveling bases so you can wall mount them. The center channel is the same as the sattelites except it is on its side, but again the base moves for wall mounting. The sound is controlled by a sound dock with a large knob, and a few buttons that let you control settings and all that good stuff. The back has one input for coax digital, one for optical digital, and a direct 6 channel input. The side has an input for headphones, and one underneath for a headphone to headphone jack (for MP3 players and such).Then there is the sub. This 50 pound monster is a 188 watt side firing sub that delivers rock solid bass. Now some reviews of ""the house shaking"" are a little extreme. If you set the right EQ and crank the volume, then yes, you will rattle your brain. Most of the time the sound is more conservative.The Z-5500 sounds great and has tons of power. There is no lack of it. This system gets REALLY loud. It can hit a level of loud that makes conversation impossible and a level of loud that keeps the party going. For a lot of system, turning the volume to 50% is unrealistic because the more you turn it up, the more distortion and lack of power you get. That 50% is really more like %80 of the power you have. Not here. When you crank it up you realize that the Z-5500 will keep up with you. I fear to put it past 75% of the max volume for fear of the cops being called.The quality of the sound is also very good. There is great separation from the speakers no matter what mode you are listening to. Movies with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound great. DTS even better. For music, there are Pro Logic II modes to create a fake 5.1 experience, on top of the standard stereo and quad sound (the rears playing the front mix). The only thing worth mentioning is that unless you have a great EQ for your computer, sometimes the bass and highs are a little too much. These are not the best sounding speakers I have ever heard, but they get really loud and sometimes the shock value alone of the sound they produce hides any disappointment in the full range.So in short...Pros -- Way more power than you need at your desk. This is really nice for action movies or loud music. Watching other people when I crank it is always great. They always get that ""holy crap!"" look on their faces because they are being rocked by a wall of sound.- Easy to control and set up. If you are interested in expensive 5.1 speakers for your computer than you probably won\'t find this to be anything over your head.- Nice clean look to the package. The satellites are not huge, and the sound dock has a nice look to it with the light blue display.- This can hook up to almost anything, making it a good solution for DVD players, or an Xbox 360, etc.- The different audio modes are nice. Pro Logic II modes, Dolby Digital, DTS, etc.. You can really mix it all up here.Cons -- The sub is really big, and can limit where you can put this. On top of this, it is heavy, making hauling this system a little bit of a workout.- The included remote is cheap and does not fit in with the quality of the build.Overall -Lots of power in a nice looking package. This system hooks up to a lot and sounds good doing it. I am happy with my purchase and offer a high recommendation.',)"

"('My current rig as of 1/2011:-Fluance SXHTB+-JBL ES250PBK 400-Watt High-Powered 12-Inch Subwoofer-Harman Kardon AVR 2600 Receiver-PlayStation 3 using 1.4a HDMI cables from Amazon on Linear PCM settings(not MonsterRipOffs)I went from Infinity TSS-750 series satellite speakers to these Fluance speakers, and I have to say, they\'re simply amazing. I can\'t really compare to any other bookshelf speakers, only satellite speakers. However, I have heard speakers like these in the store and frankly, I couldn\'t tell you the difference between these and Polk audio.As for shipping, Fluance is a smaller company and you can only buy the speakers from them, so I was expecting a long wait time. Shipping from Canada (I assume, since they\'re based there), my speakers were there by the end of the week after ordering on a Monday. I considered that to be speedy delivery. Before ordering though, I did have to wait for several months because they were out of stock, but I wasn\'t ready to buy then anyway.What\'s included are two bookshelf speakers, a center, and two rear/sides (whichever you prefer). On Fluance\'s website, you can order two more speakers for complete 7.1 audio for $39.99 a speaker. The picture doesn\'t do them justice. I was going to actually paint the speakers black, as I hate ""wood"" looking furniture, but these are a bit darker than the picture advertises them to be. They actually blend pretty well with darker furniture. This comes from my wife as well, who didn\'t want to buy these just because she hates the wood look. But she instantly liked the darker color they arrived in.Setting these suckers up was a little new to me. Again, I never had bookshelf speakers before, so I didn\'t know I needed to have two wires per speaker, but I guess I should have figured that out. After I got them setup, my receiver did all the work as far as configuring them, with me tweaking them a bit.Now, I bought the subwoofer mentioned above at the exact same time. That sucker is huge, and packs a nice punch. But after the first day, I turned it off so I could play games at night, and really, I haven\'t used the subwoofer hardly since. My Blu-rays and games manage to boom at the appropriate moments, without the subwoofer. Often times, I felt like I was using my old subwoofer for bass, just from the speakers. They\'re not going to rattle windows, and tear down the roof, but they\'re great if you don\'t want to be too loud because of neighbors/sleeping wife.The price, the quality, and the look is perfect. If someone broke in my house and robbed me blind, I wouldn\'t think twice about buying these again. At $299 (plus about $80 shipping), these really feel like a steal. Everyone that has heard them has been greatly impressed, and I feel if you\'re planning on getting a Polk audio set, consider Fluance as a superior product than them since they sound the exact same and cost way less.',)"

"('At first, I was pretty excited about receiving this tripod.  At first glance, it seems to be a great product for its price -- the legs seem sturdy, it\'s got a convenient accessory hook and a useful carrying handle, plus it came with its own carrying case and built-in bubble levels!The problem with the tripod, I think, is that it\'s poorly constructed, or at least it\'s made out of cheap material.  There are a lot of weak plastic parts that seem like they would break easily with moderate use.  At first, I chose to ignore these flaws considering the low price (mostly, I was worried the frail snaps on the legs would break), but on my third photoshoot, the vertical adjustment knob died on me.I was using a wireless remote shutter (which is to say that I wasn\'t even touching the tripod) and suddenly, my camera swung down and my zoom lens crashed back into the tripod.  Luckily, nothing broke, but I was still pretty worried.  After checking to make sure that it wasn\'t my fault (maybe I didn\'t tighten it properly?), I realized that the vertical adjustment knob was completely busted -- no matter how much I tried to tighten it, it stayed loose.  I removed it completely and found broken bits of plastic threading, which could only mean that I\'d have to get the tripod replaced -- it should have been made out of metal.But even assuming that my particular tripod was defective to begin with, this is not a great tripod to purchase in general.  The weak plastic parts are always a concern, even if the vertical knob doesn\'t break like mine did (besides the plastic snaps, the crank handle and accessory hook are also plastic).In terms of convenience, although it\'s great to have a tripod tall enough (70"" is GREAT if you\'re looking for a taller tripod), it\'s pretty inconveniently bulky when collapsed to its minimum length -- but I suppose that\'s a necessary compromise for having a taller tripod.  The built in bubble levels are useful too, unless you\'re vertically orienting your camera -- then, there is no bubble level for that orientation, so it\'s hard to be sure your horizon is properly aligned (unless you have one of those fancy $70+ photography hotshoe bubble levels.  Or unless you just never turn your camera and take pictures vertically on this tripod.).There\'s also a detachable plate which makes switching from handheld shots to tripod shots really quick and easy (which I love).  Technically speaking, I suppose that\'s just another movable part that may promote vibrations that keep your pictures from looking tack sharp, but for its convenience, it is more than forgivable.Aesthetically speaking, the tripod is a bit disappointing.  Those dull plastic parts look really tacky, although they make the tripod relatively lightweight.Finally, the name ""Professional"" photo/video tripod is a misnomer.  Although I am an amateur/enthusiast myself, I highly doubt any professional would use this tripod instead of a good ballhead tripod.  In my opinion, (and in retrospect) the convenience of a ballhead tripod make even the most inexpensive ballhead tripod worth it (but be prepared to pay at least 4 times more for one than for a tripod like this one).  Plus, with a ballhead tripod, you\'ll at least LOOK more like a professional photographer, even if you don\'t know what you\'re doing :)Overall, I would not recommend buying this tripod.  Instead, do yourself a favor -- buy a ballhead.  I\'d suggest anything by Bogen/Manfrotto for starters.  Hope this helps!',)"
"(""If you have the cash to spare and love taking photos there is only one thing to know.  Buy a 20D.  As soon as possible.  You will be thrilled.  There is no doubt that it is among the best cameras the world has ever seen.  I did my research before deciding to buy a 20D.  I looked seriously at the Nikon D70, another excellent digital SLR camera and a fair bit cheaper than the 20D, but I chose the 20D for its ruggedness, slightly larger 8mp sensor, and outstanding autofocus.What is amazing about this camera?  Put it on automatic and squeeze the shutter release.  In a second you have taken 5 shots.  You can take 20 in four seconds, each 8 megapixels in size while the autofocus tracks your running toddler.  It feels GREAT in your hand, very sturdy and not overly heavy.  Perhaps  a tad bulky compared to the digital camera you may be used to.  But I find it a joy to hold and use.It can speed up to ISO 3200 without introducing excessive noise into the image and at 1600 and 800, noise is almost unnoticeable.  That means you can take handheld photos without flash indoors in the evening under ambient room light conditions (the 50mm mentioned below, with its large maximum aperture helps too in this regard).You could spend days researching lenses and accessories.  If you are just wading in to high-end amateur photography, let me make some quick and dirty suggestions:The kit lens (EF-S 18-55mm) is a very good lens for the insanely cheap price of $100.  The EFS 17-85 which pros rave about is pricey at $600 and you don't need the 55-85 range much I find -- you will probably consider a decent telephoto (like a 70-300mm) to be a better use of your cash.  You may well grow tired of the 18-55 eventually, but it does give you access to wide angle shots at a cheap price.You absolutely MUST buy the ($75) 50mm f1.8.  It is a truly outstanding lens for headshots and portraits.  It has fantastic depth of field control allowing you to achieve a nice background blur, and is very very sharp within the depth of field.  You will use this lens a lot.  Some say it's cheaply made.  Probably, but it works wonders and the price is definitely right.  50mm was standard on analog SLRs supposedly due to its rough equivalence to how the human eye observed a scene.  On the 20D it becomes an 80mm lens due to the 1.6x crop factor, and at that length becomes the perfect portrait lens in my view.If you want to photograph ships, houses and palaces, the EF-S 10-22mm f3.5 is a treasure that'll set you back $800.  It's definitely not a good general purpose lens, but how cool is it to have a wide angle zoom?You do NOT need a high speed compact flash card, but you DO need a big one.  If you have a 4x 512MB CF, keep it and it will work well with the 20D.  A 256MB card will fill up pretty fast as you will become addicted to firing off several shots at once.  Sure the 1GB cards are down in price considerably, but don't throw out your old 256 or 512s.  The buffer on the 20D is very large, and will transfer the images from the camera to the card during idle time quite happily.  Of course if you want to run off 30 images in 6 seconds, go for the ultra or 80x cards.  You don't need my advice either.Buy it and love it.  You'll never go back."",)"
"('Disappointed with large room/high ceiling picture results with my Canon 420EX speedlight (see my review) mounted on my Canon dRebel - sent me shopping about 6 months ago for more light (you can never have enough light). My E-TTL flash metering with the 420EX also proved uneven - with sometimes unexpected over exposures and blown highlights. A solution for both was found!The 580EX appears to get me an additional TWO F-Stops and much better metering (E-TTL2) on my new Canon D20. Less time in Photoshop with better exposures, fewer blown highlights and the fantastic multi-shot strobe function are paying dividends with every indoor photoshoot I cover. It is worth the price for people who use the camera for a living - or are serious ""pro-sumer"" phototographers.I\'ve since purchased a Canon D20 camera - paired it with my 580EX and am EXTREMELY happy with the result. The two items are made for each other. As happy as I am with my 300D (dRebel) and overall happy with my 420EX (see my review) the 580EX has allowed me to take my photography to the next level.I carry 3 sets (4AA) of 2500 amp/hr Ni-Mh rechargables good for over 100-150 (or more) shots per battery charge. I ""fast recharge"" two sets while using the other. I\'m investigating a battery pack - but have not yet justified the expense - as the Ni-Mn rechargable prices continue to tumble.Using my dRebel, I shoot portraits with a battery grip from Canon (BGE1-see my review) and a speedlight flip bracket from Stroboframe (see review) and the Canon hotshoe off camera shoe cord (see my review). The lighter weight of the 580EX than the older 550EX which I nixed - allows me longer shoots with less hand fatigue and better camera balance. Be aware it is still larger and heavier than the smaller 420EX and is not for everyone.The 580EX is a Canon ""Master"" speedlight - allowing my 420EX life extension as a very dependable ""slave"" unit with very positive results on my portrait and event work.Is it worth the price?Yes - if:1. You can never have enough light2. You are a professional or serious hobbyist3. Are having metering problems with E-TTL metered speedlights4. Need a ""Master"" speedlight to power a ""slave"" unit5. It doesn\'t break your bankNo - if:1. You are a casual photographer (420EX should work fine)2. You are on a budget (420EX should work mostly fine)3. Don\'t need the performance and features (which are twice the cost of the 420EX).Canon products are well made, well engineered, dependable and fairly priced. All my major purchases of cameras, lenses, speedlights and printers have all been good performers over time.With that said, the battery door gives me the same occasional latching problem that my 420EX exhibits (rolling batteries around on the floor in front of a client is NOT a pretty sight -- I know - I shouldn\'t be in such a hurry...The Canon 580EX: for the discriminating and serious photographer. More than just an expensive toy - but still not for everyone!',)"

"('This lens has a TON of reviews... so I\'ll stick to a short couple of lists/facts. These are all from my PERSONAL experience with my particular lens, and in no way is an attempt to regurgitate over used buzz words or other peoples ""facts"".What\'s hot?* Sharp Optics (Surprisingly so. Better than my Canon 28-135mm IS USM and Tamron 70-300mm at their best)* Full-time manual focus override* Super wide angle to ~almost~ ""normal"" on a ASP-C (cropped) sensor* Smooth operation, good fit and finish. Not a metal barrel, but still feels solid* Good contrast* Handles distortion VERY well when zoomed all the way out (though it\'s still there, as is to be expected from something that gets THIS wide)* Will hold it\'s value, even used* Good, minimal focus distanceWhat\'s not?* Chromatic aberration rears it\'s ugly head when wide open and kicking it around 10mm\'s. I hear it\'s better than most the other choices in this range, but it\'s still more than I\'m a fan of. (This can be, mostly, compensated for by zooming in to about 12mm\'s, or stopping down a little more.)* Not ""weather sealed"". I personally haven\'t had any issues, but when I go hunting for an epic landscape shot, I shy away sometimes if the weather is particularly rainy because while my 7D can take it... my lens might not be so lucky.* Pricey* Won\'t stay with me if I go ""Full Frame"" (EF-S mount)* Without IS or F/2.8, it\'s usable, but not ideal for low-light shots with subject movement or no tripod. (Usable, but not ideal)Final Word:If you\'re running an ASP-C sized sensor on your Canon Rebel, xxD, or 7D and you\'re looking for ""real"" super wide angle shots, there aren\'t many choices to be had. BUT... when you have to pull the trigger, I highly recommend this lens and would purchase it again if I had too. If you do not need quite as wide a shot, as much usable range, shoot in lower light, and looking to save about $100... I\'d go with a Tokina 11-16mm. I hear it\'s supposed to be pretty good as well... but I have no personal experience with it. You win some and lose some either way... but my final word is... the Canon 10-22mm is tough to beat. Buy it, be amazed. I know I was.',)"
"('There are three ways to evaluate the worth and value of a lens:  Reviews that provide you measured numbers, Reviews that give you someone\'s opinion, and using it yourself.I suppose all have some merit. Numbers are facts. If there is measurable falloff in the corners or low numerical resolution at a particular part of the zoom range such reviews will show it. People\'s opinions can have merit too - but first you kind of need a review of the reviewer. Do they know their stuff? Are their needs and expectations similar to your own? Have they used it enough to really know the Len\'s strengths and weaknesses?The final one -- using it yourself is in the end the best. This because numbers say little about pictures. No, really, they don\'t.  Doubt that? Then look at the great photos taken when even the best lenses lacked the basic qualities demanded of the least expensive SLR lenses today.  Do you say ""gee, great pic but the lens sucks""?  No.  And some people who write a review have special needs that will have little impact on YOU.  An architectural photographer for instance.  Even a little curvature in a straight line will drive him crazy. But on your vacation photos of the mountains or the beaches you won\'t even notice that flaw.Fall off (""vignetting"") can be a big deal if its bad. But most falloff from a modern DSLR lenses can be corrected almost 100% with basic software. (And the same is true for linear distortion btw.)So the best way to check out a lens is to use it yourself.All of these points came to me (again) when I purchased this EF-S 17 -85mm lens. Measurable fall off? At some zoom settings its got gobs. Distortion?  At wide setting ditto. Resolution?  Good to middling. But for all that this lens for many photographers -- including serious ones -- would be a great addition to their kit.BYW, I probably would be judged in that later, ""serious"", category myself. I\'ve earned a good living as a photographer for over 40 years. My work has graced hundreds of articles, books, and more recently, web sites. And my ""art"" images have been displayed in a \'one man show\' in an art-conscious community.OK then, what does my use tell me about this lens?Pluses:1) It has a really useful zoom range that encompasses a wide range of shots.2) It is light and relatively compact.3) Its resolution may not look great when presented in numbers, but it does look great in the photos I\'ve taken with it.4) When quick processed with appropriate editing software (I use Lightroom) the falloff and linear distortion is approximately zero.5) Being discontinued and replaced by a measurably better but MUCH more expensive lens in Canon\'s catalog one can be be gotten for a song and maybe, with some luck, just a half stanza.  (I got one recently in like new condition -- box, caps and all -- for less than $350.Minuses:1) Very limited macro capability2) Some reported mechanical problems.Regarding the positives: Yes! A Steal! Go for it!Regarding the negatives: It is a daily use lens that for many photographers will see 3 or 4 (or more) time on their camera than a more extreme type of lens. Thus problems will on that basis alone be more common. And any problem is more likely to be mentioned in a review than none just because that is human nature.  (Which of your feet are you most likely to mention in a conversation, the one that hurts or the one that doesn\'t?)Bottom line: Find one cheap. Buy it. Use it. Enjoy! And for that price if it does break have it fixed.That\'s what I did and it works for me. :)',)"
"('Upon receipt, I thought this bag was way too big. I had completely misunderestimated (heh) the size from online pictures. My T3i + kit lens looked absolutely pathetic sitting inside of it. There were three times the number of zippered pockets and velcro dividers than I could find a use for. Having just stepped into the DSLR world, I was convinced there was no way I\'d ""grow"" into it. Reluctantly, I decided to keep it--mainly for the wonderful protection and because I couldn\'t argue with the price.Fast forward about a month later, and I am loving this bag!

"('Let\'s start with the major negative. You already know it just by looking: No screen. You can\'t see the song you\'re listening to, you can\'t quickly find the song you want, you can\'t look at the clock. It was definitely a risky move by Apple. I\'d like to say it doesn\'t bother me, but it does. I would like to have a screen.Let\'s move on for now; we\'ll get back to the negatives later.The first thing I thought when I saw the Shuffle was, ""It\'s that small? I could keep that in my pocket all the time."" It\'s truly shocking how small the thing is. I am in awe of the whole thing: An amazingly player with about 16 hours of battery life (my measurement), superb sound (at least as good as the other iPods), and a 512 MB memory that I can use to carry my work from computer to computer.Let\'s look at the Shuffle\'s benefits compared to other flash players: size and convenience. First the size. It\'s almost half the size and weight of the smallest other flash player. That means it can be a permanent part of your daily life. The second factor is convenience. With other flash players, you can expect to carry around a black usb cord to connect the player to the computer. Take it from me: It\'s annoying. Apple was able to include the usb attachment on the Shuffle because the Shuffle is so small. That means no cord. Just slip your little Shuffle into your pocket and go. With other players, you need to take a player at least twice as big PLUS a cord. Not so easy.Back to the negatives now. The Shuffle also lacks a voice recorder. Apparently, a great deal of people spend their time recording conversations. I never have recorded from my other MP3 player, but I should probably start being careful of what I say. This might be an important consideration for some people, particularly spies and the ilk, but I see no need for it.The other feature the Shuffle lacks is a radio. I wouldn\'t mind a radio on the Shuffle so I could listen to the TV programs at the gym (they broadcast the sound on unused FM spectrum). I don\'t understand why Apple doesn\'t include this with their other iPods, but obviously the Shuffle can\'t have a radio because it doesn\'t have a screen with which to see the station.The Shuffle is a clear winner if you want an attractive, go-anywhere, easy-to-use, inexpensive, great-sounding music player. If you want something more, such as a radio, a voice recorder (again, why?), or a way to manage the 120 to 240 songs on the player, then you have to buy something else.Personally, I bought the Shuffle because of the size and convenience. I already have a big 20 gig MP3 player, but I wanted something I could carry in my pocket and not have to worry about. I love reaching into my pocket and copying over a file from a friend\'s computer; when I drive home, I listen to tunes on the Shuffle (through the car radio), then I forget it\'s in my pocket until I need it again.I\'d still like a screen, though.',)"
"('I bought this after reading Amazon user comments. Most of them say it is a snap. It must be. For some.After having to return the first unit for hardware failure after 1 day and a 30 min phone call to... New Delhi I had another one delivered. This one worked but it would not talk to my Netgear wireless router. It would take forever to find the network address and then it would either fail or establish a limited connection. I tried to update the firmware on my own which is not as well done as in the router.Then I decided to call India again. Sam, a very good, knowledgeable guy helped me (another 45 minutes of troubleshooting). He closed the case too, after updating the firmware and verifying that the stuff worked.We finished with him saying: ""now you can move the Access point to any location and it will work""... No, it did not. And it is not because of my electrical system. The 2 adapters in fact talk to each other.I do not know what it is but what happens is that the connection with the extender is very difficult to obtain; it comes and goes; it is much more dependent on what wireless receiver is on the other hand. One computer works at times, another not at all... you know what I mean.All of this with one adapter upstairs, one downstairs in my very middle class (=small) home and trying to connect from feet away from the access point...For your reference: I use an up to date XP tablet edition OS and, as I said, a Netgear WGT624 router. I use WEP 128bit and MAC access discrimination.On this note, finally, I do not understand the comments of the reader who complains about low level security. As for the 624, the 102 allows setting of WEP 128 bits and MAC address discrimination.Product is heading back to Netgear. I will wait for something better and will continue to move or keep my arms up or knee down in order to get signal where I want it...My regards to the vast wireless community.',)"

"('PRODUCT UPDATE #4:  Received my ""new"" Wave System from Bose on 12/27/13.  As of today (3/5/14) this is the FOURTH one being returned because of problems playing CDs.  Customer Service rep informed me that the unit I was sent back in December was NOT A NEW ONE BUT A REFURBISHED UNIT!!!  This time they swear they will be sending me a System III unit.  What are the odds this one will still be working come the summer?PRODUCT UPDATE #3: Received an e-mail from Bose on 12/26/13 telling me they received a shipment of my original model Wave System!!  This is just FOUR DAYS after telling me the unit was discontinued.  New one should arrive today or tomorrow and I have absolutely no faith this one will work any better than the previous fourPRODUCT UPDATE #2:  Received an e-mail from Bose today (12/22/13) telling me that defective Bose unit is no longer in production.  My old Bose system will be replaced by a Wave Music System III.  Pardon me if I remain skeptical that this one will be any better.PRODUCT UPDATE:  As of today (12/16/13) my Bose unit is being returned for the FOURTH TIME!!!  Bose has agreed to swap out the old unit for a brand new one.  So we\'ll see.  The only positive this time is that the Customer Service rep did not attempt to dance around the problem and agreed to the replacement almost immediately.I received the Bose System last year as a Christmas gift.  Nice and easy to hook up.  Looks modern and stylish.  So far, so good.Turned the radio on to classical station and wasn\'t as impressed by the sound as I expected to be.  Very flat with no way to accentuate the highs or lows because, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there are no bass and treble controls.  So be it, I can live with that.Next step was try a few CDs.  I inserted the first - a home burnt disc - and watched as the front display blinked ""Reading Disc"" for THREE solid minutes.  I ejected the disc and reinserted it.  Two minutes later I ejected it again.  The third time I had to press the ""Eject"" button on the remote numerous times before I was able to retrieve my CD. Finally on the fourth attempt it played.Enjoyed the music for a while and tried a second CD.  This time after a minute or so of ""Reading Disc"" the Bose system informed me this disc was ""Not Playable"".  Again, as other reviewers have noted, these CDs worked in EVERY other machine that tried to play them.  Just for interest\'s sake I then tried a commercially made CD.  Music started up almost immediately but come Track #11 the music skipped like somebody had bumped into your old turntable.A few days later I called Bose to report these problems.  They agreed to exchange this unit for a new one.  New one is received and works slightly better than the original.  It plays most of my burnt CDs (about 90% of them anyway) without having to reinsert them multiple times...until a month or so ago.  Now I\'m back to not knowing when I put a disc in if it\'s going to play or not.At this point I e-mailed Bose Tech Support and called them as well just to see if they came up with similar ideas.  Right off the bat I could tell the guy on the phone had his ""manual"" in front of him with the standard solutions:  use a better quality blank CD (I use only brand name CD-Rs like Sony, TDK, Fuji, etc.), burn the discs at a slower speed (I burn my CDs at 4X), try a different software program, and, my all-time favorite, wait a little longer for the burnt CD to cool off!  Yes he actually told me that.  And the e-mail response I got was just more of the same.I recently traded in my second Bose for a third one (The original Bose was a Christmas present from my wife and I don\'t want to hurt her feelings by telling her I think it\'s a piece of junk).  I\'ve had this one a few days and it\'s no better than the other ones.  Just for kicks I called Bose a short time ago and run through the whole thing with the guy.  This tech\'s response was that if you burn 10 CDs they are all not going to be of the same quality.  I asked him why they were ALL good enough to play on my $30 boom box, a $75 CD player at work, and my computer\'s disc drive but the $500 Bose System couldn\'t do any better than 7 out of 10.  No answer.  I then asked him why Bose felt the need to inundate the airwaves and newspapers with ads for this machine instead of taking some of their profits and developing an optical drive that worked the way it should.  ""Well, sir"", he replied, ""I\'ll certainly pass on your concerns"". I feel better now.Two more things:  when you receive the system from Bose enclosed is a typed sheet Bose refers to as ""Our Commitment To You"".  Part of this sheet of baloney states: ""And we strive to avoid flashy sounds such as those associated with accentuated bass and/or treble frequencies.  While those sounds may be initially attractive to the novice, they are not real and are not enduring"".In addition to selling an electronic paperweight for $500 Bose has the audacity to tell you that you don\'t have any idea what music should sound like.  Only Bose knows.  Granted we\'re all not sound engineers but we do know how we like our music. That\'s like going out for a meal and not being able to use any of the condiments on your steak or use sugar in your coffee because the chef has decided you\'re too dumb to know it tastes better his way!The last thing is the segment of the ad campaign where someone from Forbes is quoted as saying this system sounds better than one costing five times as much.  If that loon couldn\'t do any better than this with $2,500 to spend I\'d have to question his effort or assume he was on Bose\'s payroll.Overpriced. Overhyped.  No tone controls.  A remote that\'s too easily misplaced or lost.  Non-existent tech support.  A major MAJOR disappointment.  Do not buy!',)"
"('when combined with a CS1 center.  Could not be happier.  Clear with good sound field.',)"
"(""Summary: bright earphones with good tonal quality, adequately comfortable, with great insulation.  Construction could be better.These earbud phones complement my other open, full-size cans (Sennheiser HD 580, AKG 240M).  Mostly I listen to MP3 played on my computer.  My setup is simple, just an amplified external D/A converter (M-Audio Audiophile USB) because the audio card of my laptop is ratty.  Most of the recordings are 192 kbps cbr mp3.  For the record, my ears work between 18Hz and 16kHz as tested; beyond that I'm deaf.I've owned the ER6i for quite a while (months), and I'm generally happy with them.  They come with a soft case the size of a small soap bar that is convenient for transport; a set of foam plugs; and a set of soft 3-flanged plugs.  The fit to my ear canal of the flanged plugs is very satisfactory, to the extent that at time after inserting them I have to release pressure from my ears as when changing elevation in an airplane.  I've never tried the foam plugs.  Insulation with the flanged plugs is effective to the point of being dangerous: OK in an office or in comparable circumstances, but inappropriate almost anywhere else.  Since I have no means to quantify the degree of insulation, I can only comment that it's difficult for me to hear the phone ringing on my desk when listening to music at moderate levels.The sound quality is good.  The following is a short, subjective comparison with the HD580.  Bass: precise and measured, a bit thinner than the HD580, which are not bass-heavy to start with.  Drums come out well defined and without smears.  Low range strings are just beautiful.  If you are a bass monkey, however, you may be disappointed unless you process the signal beforehand.  These earbuds can reproduce a big bass if the source requires it or the listener so prefers; but they may need encouragement in the latter case.  Midrange: sharp, pleasant, balanced.  Never too present or too far.  Almost as analytical as the HD580.  What else is to be said?  High:  a lot more generous than the HD580, but still well controlled.  When the source is good, it's a pleasure; if the source is poor it's not very forgiving.  Even if evident, however, the high range is not overpowering.  Watch out for cranky or noisy amps, like that built into my laptop: they are devastating to the ER6i.  Perhaps this is the reason I had to improve on it . . ..  Fortunately my external D/A is totally silent, no hiss at all that I can hear.My main complaint about these earphones is about their mechanical construction.  Perhaps by design the intent was to create a very light accessory; if that was the goal it has been achieved with a vengeance.  They are lightweight to the point of being borderline flimsy.  Handling with care is greatly recommended.In a sentence, very very good value."",)"
"(""In short they work great. I mounted my Sirius Starmate replay on my motorcycle's tankbag. It is powered by the bike.The ER6i's produce enough sound with the Starmate alone and they REALLY isolate the outside noises--much better than foam earplugs.They are a little flimsy, but this is a case of the reisk is worth the reward.John"",)"

"('I have owned this remote for about a year now. I have a full blown home entertainment center with mixed components, including HDTV, satellite receiver, DVD, VCR, video processor, etceteras.I agree with most reviewers that the online setup is really impressive and worked right the very first time, once you put in your model numbers correctly. I was shocked to see that they even had my video processor (an iScan Ultra) as a selection, because this is a pretty unusual component.The next thing I like is the ability of the remote to help the not-so-techies through the process of getting their systems turned on and off and set up for different functions. With all other universal remotes I have seen, as long as everything goes perfectly, all is well, but the first time the amp fails to turn off when you select the ""all off"" on the remote, you get out of sync and figuring out how to re-sync is a nightmare for my wife, mother, and kids. The Help function makes re-syncing easy. Of course if you know what you are doing you can re-sync without using the Help function, something I\'m not sure was made clear in other reviews.The power consumption is impressively low, I have only changed the batteries twice in a two year period, and the unit\'s shape is comfortable to hold. Also, I have contacted customer service with a couple of questions and problems and have found it excellent in terms of response time and courteousness. Perhaps one of the best ever for an electronic component that I have experienced. Hats off to Harmony on that one.Now for the negatives. Several buttons failed to program correctly. I finally did get them to work right but it did take some patience.Perhaps the most annoying negative, though, is the tiny buttons for things like INFO and EXIT, two functions that you need to use continuously when surfing with a satellite receiver. This is inexcusable. You must turn on the backlight and physically LOOK for these buttons each and every time or you will miss them and accidentally hit the volume button or the channel up/down button. Even the number buttons are crowded so close together that you end up hitting the wrong one constantly unless you are looking at it. Extremely annoying, enough so that I am looking at upgrading to the new 880. (Update: Which I have now done - see my review.)Also annoying is the shape of the central joystick component. It\'s just not very ergonomic. It\'s a raised ring that is only about a millimeter wide. Your finger can feel it easily enough, but it just does not feel comfortable and could have been so much better.Other flaws, which can probably be resolved with patience, include that the not-frequently-used functions on my components are not easy to get to at ALL, and many of them are incorrectly labeled or don\'t work, period. In order to resolve this I will have to go into the website and completely redo the programming for each button, manually programming them as I go. This to me defeats the benefit of having the component available online. What they really mean is that the on/off and other MAJOR functions will be correct, but the detailed programming, like changing from Dolby 5.1 to Dolby Enhanced 5.1 or Jazz Club effect on my amp, will not be.(Update: I finally got around to reprogramming all the soft buttons. Once you get the hang of it, it\'s not a terribly long process, but it should have a function that allows you to just clean out every soft button and start from scratch. Instead you have to clear each one individually. Not a major barrier, just a gripe.)The LCD screen only offers a few characters worth of width, so many labels have to be abbreviated. This makes the programming very cluttered and unprofessional looking, not to mention having to get creative with some abbreviations. A wider screen with higher resolution is what needs to happen here; you will be very disappointed by the screen on this unit, to the point of not using it very often; it\'s sometimes much easier to walk up to the component and make the change manually than to have to surf to the right LCD button. (Update: the 880 addresses the screen issue very well.)There is a function to allow you to download the titles of all the on-air programs right to the remote, so that you can literally see what\'s on by looking at the LCD. Forget it; it\'s not worth the effort due to the tiny screen and the time required to download it. A total waste of what could have been a handy feature.We still have two other OEM remotes available at all times to deal with the shortcomings of this unit. I still believe in the concept, it just needs some refining. (Update: I now use this remote in my bedroom and the 880 with the main entertainment unit. The refinements I had hoped for are indeed taken care of on the 880.)',)"
"('As anyone with multiple electronic devices knows, less is better when it comes to remotes. One remote that does everything would be ideal. This one has a couple of killer features: Internet-based setup via USB, and ""state awareness"". With the Harmony 688, you merely install the driver, plug it into a USB port on your PC, and use Logitech\'s web-based configuration utility. Only in the rarest of circumstances will you need to point your existing remote and ""learn"" by pressing buttons (but you can do this if needed). Configuration can be arduous, but only because of the large number of parameters. It\'s easier to set up than other universal remotes although the configuration Web site could be easier to use. For example, if you want to customize buttons for each device, you click ""My Remote Preferences"", whereas setting up the activities and their related buttons takes place in a different menu. It took me about an hour to do the initial setup, and a couple of short tweaks later I was done (I had initially chosen the wrong audio input mode for the DVD activity).The 688 uses an ""activity"" paradigm (""watch tv"", ""listen to music"", etc.) Each activity is a functional mode of operation, combining the required macros, punch-throughs, and custom button definitions. The very best part of this remote is the state awareness. It remembers which devices are turned on, and can negotiate sequential input values (the ones where you cycle through each setting until you hit the one you want). This remote really reduces the amount of fiddling around, and lets you get down to the business of being entertained. For example, if you want to watch a DVD you simply select that activity. All of the appropriate devices are then turned on and the proper settings are selected. My TV\'s TV/Video selector cycles through the active inputs. You can\'t use standard macro programming to get around this problem, but the 688 doesn\'t skip a beat. It knows exactly how everything is set.Prior to beginning the setup process, do your homework. Jot down all your brands/model numbers, which devices use which inputs for each activity, and the order of any cycled inputs. It\'s much easier if your computer is in the same room for setup (no problem if your setup includes a PC; laptop owners should consider using the laptop). The PC connection is only required for the initial setup.PROS:* Easy to configure, lots of options.* Knows which devices are on, eliminating fuddling at TV time. This alone is worth the price of admission.* Non-volatile memory; if your batteries die your settings are safe.* Perfect for setups with TiVo or satelllite; can handle systems with both.* Knows what a Turtle Beach Audiotron is!CONS:* Dinky buttons.* Volume controls are ""sticky"", not as responsive as I\'d like.* Initial configuration can be daunting due to number of options. Default device configurations are lengthy and take some time to edit. Default activity configs are set up well, nice because this is where you will spend most of your time.* Web configuration could be set up more intuitively; some devices are not listed, and input values were incorrect for at least one of my devices. This is a minor quibble, it just requires a little extra initial effort.',)"
"(""I have owned several universal remotes in the past, including programming remotes with LCD assited labeling and pure touch-screen interfaces. All of them did their job but setup was laborous and changing home theater equipment caused pains relearning miscellanious macros. None of my previous remotes also did a good job of controlling my home theater as a whole. You know the drill - turn TV on, turn receiver on, turn cable box on and so forth. Macros were static, i.e. they operated well only for the most basic commands but could not handle various modes and intricacies of the Home Theater setup.Finally, I decided, on the friend's advice to give a try to Logitech's Harmony line. From my experience I hated touch-screen remotes as they always required looking at them for pressing pretty much any button. On the ohther hand, pure button remotes were always restrictive and required learning what the generic button means for this or that device. So the combination of the generous hard button layout and LCD screen labeling for device-specific funstions appealed to me. My friend owns Harmony 880 and I had a chance to use it a bit. I was not big fan of the touch-sensisite buttons and the way remote lights up when you shift it. Both were a distraction to me. So I looked at the 6xx series with distinct hard buttons that your fingers learn and can press without glancing at the thing. 676 was on sale and had the best layout for DVR devices which all modern TV boxes are, so I plunged.The original setup only took me about 20 minutes. I was sceptical at first of 'Activity' based modes because this was not a conventional design, but once I synched my setup back to remote and turned on my Home Theater with it for the first time, I was converted right away. The thing that nobody seems to mention about 'Activity' modes is that this is the first remote (at least from the ones I've known) that remembers state of all of your devices. No more stupid macros that could only work in one mode but were completely screwed up in another. This remote works wonders switching my video and audio outputs, controlling picture and sound preferences for each device in the group. And I have a lot of them. TV, Receiver, HDMI switch, DVD Player, PC1, PC2, Xbox 360, Wii. One remote now made all old remotes obsolete, did not lose any of the original remotes functionality and gained state awareness of each device at any time. Impressive!Pros:- easy setup through the software interface- very impressive online library of devices (including rare ones)- state-awareness of each and any device at any time- very flexible setup of video and audio switching - accomodates both direct and sequential switching between inputs- great button layout - better then the original Manufacturer's remote for DVR- controls your game consoles- very convenient in hand- only three direct activities tied to the buttons but unlimited number of additional activities that can be set up with LCD screen- MEDIA button - allows to set up favorite channels for your TV, so you no longer have to study TV channel line up and find what obscure channel number is assigned to your most viewed channels- very useful HELP button - in rare cases when one of the devices in activity failed to either turn on or switch to the proper video/audio input it will correct the situation and remember it, so it does not happen again- price. I bought it on sale (sixty dlrs) which is unbeatable for the class of the remote you get. Please do not try to compare this remote to the $20 universal remotes found at Wal-Mart. They can not hold a candle to this one in the everyday use- functionality-wise this remote is the same as any other in the Harmony line, including much more expensive ones. It has the same limitations as well (for example, not being able to control BT devices, like PS3). The software to setup any of the Harmony remotes is the same and they all use the same online database of different Home Theater devices. So if you can control your rare device with one of the Harmony remotes, you can control it with any other remote as well.Cons:- really none. The best I can come up with is that it uses AAA batteries instead of more readily available AA. Also, the LCD screen is pretty small (880 model has much better bigger color LCD screen)."",)"
"(""For those that mention that the Palm is &#34;just an organizer&#34; or not a full computer, I could prove this wrong by writing and compiling simple C programs, running VfsDOS on it, or booting a Gnu/Linux distribution on it, amongst dozens of other proofs. But just when those aren't enough to prove it, there's this keyboard--and, amazingly, when it's folded, it's not much larger than the Palm itself. Unfolded, it rivals a subnotebook, and literally suggests the real-time full appearance of a computer.I have seen pocket keyboards for palmtops through the years, but never owned one before. As a result, opening it was a bit difficult. After struggling with it for a few minutes, instead of trying to pry the keyboard out, carefully unlatch it, then slide the top part where the palmtop will sit to the right (the off and storage position is to the left). And folding it is the reverse process of this. It is a careful process to follow, in my opinion, but it does work every time with a bit of effort.I was initially discouraged to see my palmtop wouldn't respond to my keystrokes, as I originally thought the Palm OS would have the drivers/firmware/etc. pre-installed. But after a few minutes of research on the Web, I found that you have to download and open the Keyboard.prc application and switch the status to ON, as well as just leaving Beam Receive on in Prefs.Once that was complete, I tilted my palmtop on its side and changed to landscape. The keyboard worked beautifully, not missing one keystroke. Setup is literally that simple; there's really no guides to look up or manuals to read.To be honest, however, the delete key (or backspace for PC owners) seemed awkward, and the spacebar is split in two parts with a bump in front, making it ergonomically unfriendly. However, overall, this is a great keyboard, and I would definitely recommend it to whoever has a Palm, and I can confidently say that after this, I don't think I'm going to write with Graffiti anymore unless I have to."",)"
"('Preface:  I\'m not an audiophile, but I do have sensitive ears and so sound quality is very important to me.  It is so annoying that you cannot test out non-professional style headphones in most department stores, because sound performance varies greatly between all of the (many) models to choose from.After comparing specifications on many headphones, I took a chance and bought the Philips HS820.  I bought them for use with my MP3 players, both for exercise and travel.  The design appealed to me over the annoyance of jamming earbuds into my ear canals, and for the overall specifications:Sensitivity: 106db (excellent)Frequency Response: 10Hz-24kHz (excellent)Input power(IEC): 100mW (very good)If you find earbuds and over the head style headphones annoying, the neckband style (or ""street style"") headphones are a great alternative.  The band keeps the speakers comfortably adjacent to your ears without undue pressure, while still keeping the headphones secure during exercise.  I was also surprised to find that they still fit nicely with the back of my head resting on a pillow (which usually doesn\'t work well with most neckband style headphones).Compared to the default headphones that came with my MP3 player, the HS820 is easily superior. I am very impressed by the sound quality for the price (I paid $20 for these at Target).  I would have paid $40, based on the performance.  When listening to high quality MP3\'s (at least 192kbps), you can really hear the difference.  The sound level is quite well balanced and the base is reasonably good, making them enjoyable for general rock \'n roll, jazz, and classical type music.  The mid range is beautifully articulated and the highs are crisp without being too bright.  The bass is decent without being boomy (so I\'d say look elsewhere if you\'re into heavy bass hip-hop and rap).The Good:  Comfortable fit (there\'s even a thin rubber friction skin cover to prevent slipping), very convenient collapsing neckband (you can coil the cord in the middle and it stays), beautiful styling (IMHO), and very nice sound.The Not So Good:  Non-replaceable earpiece covers--if these ever get ripped or stained, you can\'t replace them.  They are light grayish in color and will darken if you have oily skin.  If anything, Philips should have either used a less absorbing material or a darker color.  After several months of use, it is easy to see dark spots where the earphones touch my ears.Overall: They are a good buy and I recommend getting them.  I would also consider Koss KSC-75\'s, which have a newer style without a neckband (they clip onto the ears).',)"
"(""This is the latest in my journey through Olympus Digital Cameras(D340R, 460,560,2020z, 5060 -- some of which I have reviewed on Amazon). The choice of the E-300, used for some commerical work I do, was not so easy because I have a bag full of Pentax K lenses and was mightily tempted by the Pentax digitals. But, having batteries, familiarity with the menu system, and really very good experience with Olympus products and service over the years, I took the plunge and got the E-300 and its kit lens. Then got a K mount adapter for my Pentax lenses and set to work.Ok, there are some quirks and I will get them out of the way:- a slight magenta cast to some greens, easily fixed in post-processing or fiddling with WB, and the noise reduction system can just slightly dull grass in photos, also easily fixed- now and then a bright spot will fool exposure slightly when using the full screen sensor (I've learned to use the center-weighted and spot meters to take care of this)- I am not overly impressed by the lcd, which doesn't seem to have the brilliance of the one on my 5060.- I wish Oly had added an xD slot for those of us with a collection of these cards, purchased for use with older modelsNow to some good stuff:- don't worry about some reviews claiming the camera is noisey and doesn't like 800/1600 ISO. I get fine results, which are easily fine tuned in Photoshop Elements, Neat Image or other programs, and which can be helped mightily by using a wide aperture prime lens at 400.- colors are brilliant and resolution sharp- the Oly jpg algorithms are very good, meaning that for most 'normal' shooting one can be perfectly happy using the best HQ mode -- lots of testing on my part discerns very little visible difference with SHQ. This is good to know when traveling or when you want to keep some disc space; triage carefully when you see that once in a lifetime shot coming and then use the highest modes- Raw is very good but by all means avoid the Olympus Master converter, which is terribly unintuitive, in favor of Adobe's.- battery life is excellent with the BLM1 battery (and yes, you can get good backups on that auction site for less than ten dollars each; and they work just fine); I've only run one battery down all the way and that was with multiple in camera editing and a download of 150 shots via USB.- flash is fine (though watch lens hood shadowing at highest aperture); I've supplemented with the FL-36 and FL-20, both of which work flawlessly, even for the brain dead like me. Like many cameras this one will occasionally underexpose so I generally program the flash for a little extra oomph.- the camera feels rugged and well made; a little tank that feels good in one's hand and thanks to lack of prism on top slides easily into a small bag.- the kit lens is really quite fine- K lenses, including a Tokina ATX telephoto zoom work easily and brilliantly, as does an OM lens with adapter.-even for the 'advanced' among us, it is good to have the range of scene modes on this camera. They work.-vastly improved instruction manual.-burns very quickly, even to standard CF cards.-finally, this thing really keeps dust off the sensor. I'm constantly fiddling between lenses in very different environmental situations and have yet to see a spec. Yes, some appear on the outer mirror, but that is easily and harmlessly cured.Olympus does not have the cache or marketing power of Nikon and Canon. And the sensor on this 4/3d's camera is smaller than those on its main competitors. Yet, I find it to be a solid andunflashly product in line with most Oly cameras I have owned. This company is good at miniaturization, glass, and compression algorithms. If you need it Oly service is excellent (quick and friendly as I found out when I screwed up something in my 5060, also a superb camera).I'm sure that there are fine photos to be had with any of the major dslr's on the market and not having a lot of comparative experience with other brands probably don't know what I am missing. But if you want an elegant workhorse with high resolution and brilliant photos give this one a careful look.------------I just thought I would provide an update for anyone who runs across one of these now ancient cameras. The bottom line is that though I have two other Oly dslr's (E-510m, and E-330) I continue to have serious attachment to this camera, which is now my 'car camera' sitting in a bag through heat and cold, with a set of 'backup' lenses. With some tweaking of the camera's color settings --slight increases in contrast and saturation -- the colors are amazing, the best I think of any of my cameras. There's just something about the sensor. My favorite combo is the camera and the very small and light Oly 14-42. It focuses quickly and accurately, and just feels great in the hand. Of course, some caveats. No image stabilization. Don't get too serious above ISO 400. But sometimes we get too, too spoiled by the latest and greatest. This isn't one of those cameras, but it keeps one thinking seriously about photography, reminds me that for generations pros used cameras much more simple than this to create great images."",)"

"(""This is an AGP card, not PCIe.I recently got this card because it is very cheap and is mainly to replace my old broken ATI Radeon 9800 pro 256 MB card which lasted since 2004 until 2008. I am getting a new rig but I want to have a video card in my old rig. Instead of replacing the 9800 pro I decided to get an ATI Radeon 9550 because the 9800 pro was prone to overheating problems and the technology is very sensitive, plus the fan is not good quality (mine fused to the metal box which sits over the card to cool it). I never overclocked.You might ask why not get Nvidia instead? The answer is I will be (my old RIVA TNT2 from 1999 never gave me trouble), but just not with this old box. Instead I will give ATI another chance, but a cheaper model will go in while a cutting edge Nvidia (probably a GeForce 8800) will go into the new box.I learned a lot about ATI from the 9800 pro model. It played games like no other card in 2004 and even maintained high performance gaming right through to 2007 but by then it emerged that the latest games where really pushing it.I did try to update the drivers to the latest Catalyst versions (7) however I would not recommend doing this with ATI. When you run ATI you stick with the drivers in the box or else you risk a problematic experience with driver updates. Personally, with ATI, I will never risk driver updates with this 9550 card. The drivers I got with it are the drivers that will always stay with it.So this card is running with a 2004 Intel P4 3.0 GHz, 1 GB Ram, 600 W PSU (updated from 300W), MSI MOBO with AGP. Anyway this rig was nothing but hell from day one because of the ATI 9800 pro and a 300W PSU. It blew the PSU and probably damaged the video card within 3 months of purchase. I didn't notice that the video card had been damaged and just got a better PSU, 600W and a Zalman heatsink. The fan in the video card had been burnt out but the Zalman seemed to keep the system cool enough for the card to run for a few more years. In 2008 the card finally packed in. So there is my story.Essentially the 9550 is little less than a 9800 pro without all the problems attached. You can even play games from 2007 with medium to high setting with this such as S.TA.L.K.E.R so I am quite happy with it. However any of the cutting edge games from 2007 onwards are really Directx 10. The 9550 is for DirectX 9.0c.The 9550 can play games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, Doom 3, FarCry and Half-Life 2.It is a nightmare if you setup your card on a television and then forget to change it back for use with a monitor. So learn a lesson well about these monitor/television compatible cards. Make sure to change the Display Properties to whichever type you are using next because if you don't then you will not see anything and thus can not change it back unless you use the last source type again. The 9550 doesn't make as much noise as the 9800. It sounds less than a 50cfm fan in your box. You do not need a very good environmental setup to keep this card cool.So if you have the kind of rig mentioned above, or something similar, and are looking to run the top end games released between 2004 and 2007 then the 9550 can do just that. It is also VISTA compatible and can run Aero.I will keep you updated on if this 9550 lasts.At the end of the day you are probably happier not chancing overclocking unless you are rich or have access to lots of hardware. I just want a system that works, doesn't overheat, doesn't explode and doesn't give me headaches like the last one did. Hopefully this review will give you some ideas of what the whole industry of PC gaming can be like."",)"
"(""I purchased this mp3 player & a Creative Muvo TX about the same time. After a few weeks w/both I gave the Creative to a friend. So hopefully this one lasts.Great features and sound. A pretty nice little mp3 player. The earbuds aren't bad but for me won't stay put. There are some pretty good ones that do though. (Griffen, Senheisers & some of the Sony's) Definitely a good buy though."",)"

"('While I am the happy owner of an Archos PMA400 meadia player, I needed a device small enough to wear on my arm while at the gym, and the Audio U2 1 GB Digital Music Player has proven to be the perfect fit.SIZE/AESTHETICS - GOODAt a capacity of 1 gig and a size and weight of a Bic lighter, the iAudio is a perfect .mp3 player for the gym. The device comes with an armband that is serviceable, but I would suggest investing in a more robust and comfortable one if you are planning on running with it.The black and silver color (there are other colors as well) is always a nice match and the plastic case holds up well to typical daily abuse, including spending a good deal of its time being stuffed at the bottom of my gym bag. And despite the small size, the buttons are large and easy to find and operate by touch alone.EASE OF USE - GOODThe device is recognized as a mass-storage device without even installing the software, which makes transferring files back and forth from the device as easy as dragging them in and out of a folder on your desktop (this makes the device an excellent choice for someone with little or no experience with them, or computers for that matter). There is some software bundled with the player, but it proves largely unnecessary and I installed the bundle after about a week.The navigation though the iAudio\'s menu system if fairly straight forward; a small joystick is used to flip through a series of menus and submenus in a standard architecture that is simply and straight-forward, with zero lag time.SOUND QUALITY - EXCELLENTI didn\'t expect too much from the device, and was blown away by just how good the sound was (which got even better after I acquired my new pair of Shure E2c headphones). The base is present and can be adjusted on a variety of levels, and midtones are crisp and sharp. And there are varieties of settings within the equalizer that allow you to customize the experience with enough precision to satisfy any but the most meticulous sound geek.BATTERY LIFE - EXCELLENTI don\'t know if it is the size of the device or not, but the battery life is simply fantastic. I would say I generally get between 18 - 22 hours of use out of it before I have to recharge, which brings me to the first real negative of the review; you can only change the device through a USB port. You can buy a separate adapter so you can plug it into the wall, but sadly it is not sold with this option, which can be annoying if you are traveling w/out a laptop.CUSTOMER SERVICE - POORIt simply could not last...my adoration with this lovely little device ended abruptly last month when I attempted to update the firmware on it via the Cowon website.  And while it proved easy enough to download the new firmware, the installation quickly spiraled into a nightmare.First, the procedure for updating the device is awkward at best.  You have to firmly hold down the play button while turning the device on to force it into ""Recovery Mode"" before connecting it to your computer.  This alone should have sent off warning bells, but I trudged along and got the device to sync up correctly, and begun to install the new firmware.  When completed, I disconnected the device as I was prompted to do so, and waited for it to power back on.I am still waiting.  Once the update was complete, the device was dead.  No matter what I tried, I was unable to get it to turn back on, and reattaching it to my computer proved equally useless.  It was as if I was handling an empty shell of plastic.  I then spent three frustrating days scouring the Cowon support site and message boards just to find that there was a restless army of other U2 owners who had experienced the same issue.  Most of them seemed stuck, but a few claimed to be able to rescue their devices through a series of complicated (and always different) solutions, each of which I tried and each which failed to rouse my device from its electronic coma.Failing all of this, I contacted Cowon\'s customer support.  I sent three emails and have yet to hear a single response to any of them.  Calling their customer support line was equally useless, as the only advice they were able to provide was to let the dive drain for the next week and try again.  When that failed, I called back and was told since my U2 was out of waranty, that there was nothing they could do despite their faulty firmware release being the cause for my problems.Because of this, I cannot in good conscious recommend this device to anyone.  It isn\'t enough that a .mp3 player preforms well when it is working; there must be a good customer support team ready when it does not, especially if that failure is wholly the company\'s fault.  Cowon has failed miserably at that point.',)"
"(""the sound is superb.  maybe not as good as the $300 headphone that i bought a few years ago, but it is close.  the interface feels easy to use.i just wish:1. the headphone doesn't use steel as the earpiece shielding, as it may rust after a year or two.2. there is an easier way to charge the unit even if you are without a USB connection.  when going on a pleasure trip, we may not have a notebook computer to charge the unit."",)"
"(""I originally purchased the Navman 3450 add-on for my PDA, and it crashed continuously, so I ended up returning it.  However, I desperately wanted a GPS because I got used to using on in a Jeep Grand Cherokee and take road trips often.  So, I bought this unit through Outpost for $349. (thanks previous reviewer!)  Amazon is almost always cheaper, but not on this...So, the hardware is well designed.  The screen is great in low ambient light, good in moderate light, but unreadable in direct sunlight.  In most situations, I can see the display well and the software lets you change the color scheme, which helps somewhat with the direct sunlight problem.The controls are sensitive, which can be annoying at times, but the unit is solidly built and the touch screen is aligned well right out of the box.  The stylus can be difficult to remove at times, but the button controls can get you most of what you need.Now for the software...This navigation software is so outdated that I cannot believe that they are actually shipping it.  The unit sometimes shows me driving in the grass a couple hundred feet NEXT to the road that I am on, or only shows part of an exit ramp and a gap to the road, where it gets lost and starts trying to recalculate route (which eats the battery life.)The software is much more solid than the PDA add-on that I had tried, but has crashed once in the 2 weeks that I have had it.  The biggest problem with this is that you have to hard reboot it and cannot get GPS satelite lock until you stop on the side of the road.  So, you can either do without GPS for the rest of your trip upon software crash or you can pull over to the side of the interstate and wait a couple minutes and then try to merge back into speeding traffic.It can be a real pain in the butt to find an address.  For example, we wanted to find an Ikea store in Baltimore.  So, you go to choose the city.  Okay, Baltimore has 12 (or 13, can't remember exactly) districts.  You have to type in the name of what you want up to the 12 (or 13) times each time you enter what you want.  So, search for the store in district 1- not found.  Okay, now you have to re-enter (why!?!!?) the name of the place and try the second district.  Not there, then repeat with each district until you either get frustrated and quit or actually find what you want.  This is the situation with the smaller cities too- you have to play the guessing game with districts.The GPS accuracy is good (but the poor software negates the positivity of this aspect.)  I give the hardware 5 stars and the software 1 star, so overall this unit gets 3 stars.  To give you a reference point, the GPS systems in cars are more expensive and have advanced hardware that ties into inertial sensors and the speedometer as well as magnetic compasses (versus GPS compases), which greatly increase accuracy and allow 'dead reckoning' when a satellite signal is briefly unavailable.  So, you have to expect a little less from a portable unit based upon physics and hardware limitations.  I do believe that this unit would benefit from an internal magnetic compass, though.I haven't decided whether to return this unit or not.  It flawlessly guided me from CT to New York City for New Years, but got confused and tried to tell me to turn around and backtrack 50 miles (adding 100 miles to my trip) when we went from NC to Maryland.  Navman will not update their antiquated software for free, and there is no guarantee that the newer version will fix any of these problems.  Be sure to buy a 512 mb or greater card, as the east coast (from florida to maine with only states that touch the coast + PA) is about 400 mb.This unit is a great value, but if performance is more important than value to you, go with the TomTom or one of the Garmin car units such as the 300 or 500.  I will base my decision on whether or not to return this on whether I can justify coughing up a couple hundred (at least) more dollars than I have already spent."",)"

"('I need to rebut the review that Marked Man ""Maverick"" posted.I received my IRiver H340 6 weeks ago and I truly love it.  I cannot imagine how I functioned without it.  Great battery life, color screen, sound, voice recorder, radio, picture viewer, text viewer and functionality.  I love that I can have my entire CD collection to listen to in the palm of my hand.  If you are a music junkie like I am then you will know there is nothing better.The only thing I do not like is the horrible case that came with it.  You cannot even access the screen or the buttons to operate the player, it is simply a holder for the player with a belt attachment.  It may not be an earth shattering issue but is something that can be improved.  I would also like to note that before I purchased the H340 I purchased the H320 model from a local Best Buy and it came with a better case that allows access to the screen and buttons.  I would really like to tell IRiver to come up with a standard case for all their players or at least let you know what the case looks like before you purchase your player.  But that information withstanding, if it truly becomes an issue you can purchase a better case from [...] for less than 40 bucks that allows access to the screen and buttons and is truly superior to the two IRiver cases.But getting back to Marked Man ""Maverick"" issues.Sound Quality:I have a pair of those ridiculously expensive Bose noise -canceling headphones and I have to disagree with his review of the treble being watered out.  Now, I understand that sound quality is subjective but there is no way the sound can be as bad as he described.  The actual MP3 quality comes down to the source music quality and the ripping method.  I can crank my IRiver through my home stereo system (a pretty expensive Onkyo 6.1 system) and it sounds fabulous.  There are also several good presets on the equalizer that can help tailor the sound of the player to your liking.Slow Boot Up:He also complained about slow boot times.  This can be tricky because if you constantly copy and delete files from the player the hard drive is going to get fragmented (like any hard drive would.)  If this becomes the case you can simply defrag the hard drive (after backing up, of course) and you will be amazed at what a difference it makes.  My player is nearly full, less than 1GB free and it boots in under a minute.  Now that may sound like a long time but this is a computer with a hard drive after all and you cannot realistically expect an instant boot.  I do not know what the boot times are for an Ipod or Creative MP3 player but I have to imagine it is also not instantaneous.Slow transfer with USB 1.1I own a Pentium 2 300 MHZ pc that runs Windows 2000 and it has a USB 1.1 connector.  It actually moves the files from the pc to player pretty fast.  I uploaded 1GB of music to the player this weekend and it took about 20 minutes.  Now I know that USB 2.0 and Firewire are really fast, but 20 minutes to move 1GB is not so bad.  I am as impatient as you can get and the transfer times don\'t really bother me. Again, I think there are some unreal expectations.As always, make your own opinions and do your research before you purchase your MP3 player.  The IRiver is not as trendy as an Ipod but it is something that I believe is much better and has way more uses than the standard Ipod, Ipod photo and Creative Labs Nomad series.',)"
"(""This is my second Kaito portable radio and it is indeed an excellent product as all the other reviewers have pointed out before me. It seems extremely well made and should last a long time if treated with care. The radio is both very small and readily transportable yet the reception is still excellent on all available bands.I especially like being able to change the AM(MW)/SW narrow/wide (bandwidth) filter setting, the DX/local RF gain switch as well as the news/music (narrow/wide) filter switch in order to improve reception of any desired signal. Using the SSB BFO fine tuner on page 9 is also very easy and straight forward as well. The ability to step tune with very small increments on pages 7-9 is also excellent in my opinion once a signal of interest has been located.I also really like the highly useful system of storing presets with the ATS system on page 0 and then being able to use the copy command to transfer them to other pages after they have been thoroughly edited into a useful list.I didn't think that I would like the digital volume controls before I got the KA1102 based on other digital volume controls that I have tried previously, but I have totally changed my mind on this very nice feature. The steps between each setting are sufficiently small that very precise control of the volume levels can be attained, especially when using earphones which is my most common mode of operating this radio. In addition however, since the volume controls are totally digital, the common problem of accidentally turning an analog volume control knob and thus changing the volume level significantly from the last use of the radio is no longer a problem at all. Too many times my ears have suffered from not properly checking an inadvertent change of the analog volume control knob setting on other radios that I have used!In addition, several people have complained about the poor English Kaito/Degen manual, but if you can't figure something out, just download the Grundig/Eton G5/E5 manual (based on the recent reworking by Grundig of the poor ergonomics of the Kaito KA1103 radio) where all other relevant details are readily explained. Grundig/Eton has recently significantly changed the fine manual that was available online until February 2008, but the new manual is still better than the Kaito manual for providing many explanations for poorly explained features.The unavailability of the LW bands on this unit is something that should be rectified by Kaitousa (pun intended) at some future date (although I have read that the Kaito KA1103 was introduced to make that specific adjustment/correction among others).Also a screen version of the signal strength meter (now done using 4 red LEDS, except in FM stereo mode where only three LEDS are used for an indication of the signal strength- see also below) should also be added as well as an indication of the DX/local switch setting as also pointed out by another reviewer.One additional idea: Kaito should make future editions of this radio so that the internal AM/MW ferrite antenna could be disconnected from the system and replaced through the external antenna jack by either an indoor or an outdoor antenna for even better AM listening (UPDATE- 5/06/2008: This am antenna decoupling has now been done for the Grundig G5 made for Grundig by Degen, the Chinese parent company for all Kaitousa products. The G5 is the updated and more expensive version of the KA1103 with all its odd ergonomic problems corrected including the famous volume control problem). Kaito still offers an antenna that inductively couples to the internal ferrite AM antenna along the top edge of the radio, but that is a clumsy way to get even better AM reception in my opinion since there is no easy way to attach the coupler directly to the radio.Finally, the choice of listening in the stereo FM mode seems to be presented redundantly (twice) on the KA1102 by the presence of both the 4th small red LED below the LCD screen and by an indication on the LCD screen itself (through the symbol, ST)?I look forward very much to having the fun of using this radio for the very high quality sounds of music, news and just general shortwave listening from all over the globe for a very long time."",)"
"(""The Kaito KA1101 is worth taking time to recommend.  I was specifically in the market for the smallest available AM/FM/SW receiver with quality performance especially in the SW bands.  The consensus of user reviews articulated favorable ratings of this unit, even as superior to its siblings---the more expensive KA1102 and KA1103 (when comparing capabilities note that the KA1101 does not cover SSB while its stablemates do).  The Amazon purchase price (April 2008) for the KA1101 was $59.95.  The order was processed within 24 hours and the package arrived three days ahead of its scheduled delivery date with free super-saver shipping from the distributor in NV.The carton contained the receiver, AC adaptor, three rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) AA batteries, stereo earbuds, a 15-foot external wire antenna, protective soft case and instructions in English.  My first impression was consistent with other reviewers who found the dark-gray receiver to be very compact and solidly built with a satisfying heft.  The battery compartment door is attached to the case so it won't fall off and get lost.  Not visible in the Amazon product marketing photos are the 29-inch/73cm collapsable mast antenna that pivots and folds off the top left of the unit and a permanently-mounted wrist strap attached to the top right corner.I live in an area where radio reception is quirky.  The KA1101's performance was a quantum improvement over an Eton S350DL on all bands and sensitivity is adjusted by a two-position sliding switch (Local/DX).  The 2.5-inch (66mm) speaker was a great sounding room-filler considering its size.  The Kaito earbuds were adequate but a pair of Bose TriPort IEs gave full and pure sound without hums, creaks, squeaks or whistles that are symptomatic of less-well-designed receiver and power supply circuitry.  Audio tone is controlled by a two-position sliding switch (Music/News).  Nice surprises were a button/keypad lock function and an ambient light sensor that moderates the display illumination.The battery charging system appeared to function as designed and is switched on by a couple of button pushes.  One potentially disastrous error for a strict literalist is the user's manual's directive to plug the 120 VAC power converter into a 220VAC outlet.  There has been criticism that the battery meter does not show a full charge when rechargeable batteries are installed.  This is addressed in the manual which states that the meter will only show 2/3 when the rechargeable cells are topped off.  This makes sense as the NiMH AA cells are rated at 1.2VDC, not 1.5VDC as in disposable cells;  on a scale where 4.5VDC is analogous to 100%, the voltmeter reflects the total available voltage, 3.6VDC with fully-charged NiMH rechargeables vs. 4.5VDC with disposables.To me, the bottom line of a radio is its ability to receive broadcast signals and provide quality audio output.  Ergonomics and programming functions are relative to individual preference and experience.  I found the KA1101 uncluttered and simple to operate.  The clock is 24-hour only but as I set mine on GMT that is not a liability.  The wrist strap that some find annoying can easily be removed with a snip of some scissors.  The black vinyl carrying case is simply that:  a simple cover solely to protect the radio from damage during transport or storage, not designed for use while the unit is playing.I was looking for a compact, multi-band unit and the KA1101 is terrific in this regard.  For someone seeking an outstanding receiver in this category I'd definitely recommend it."",)"
"('Perhaps I received a bad unit that slipped passed the Quality Control dept., but my radio was a disappointment. First off, the listing advertises that the unit comes with a carrying case--mine did not. Some customers have said that it even comes with an AC adapter--mine did not. I can live without the carrying case and even without the AC adapter. What I cannot live without is a radio that can\'t tune in a station clearly.The ONLY thing on the radio that I found acceptable was it\'s ability to tune in local AM stations. Shortwave was a bust for me. I usually use mySony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave World Band Receiver with Single Side Band Receptionfor shortwave listening. I realize the Sony is 5 times the price of this Kaito so I\'m not trying to compare the two radios across the board; however, the Kaito was not able to tune in ANY shortwave stations for me. The tuning scale makes reading what station you are tuning very difficult so perhaps I simply didn\'t tune the shortwave band in correctly.Even so, I was unable to tune in ANY FM stations. I live in a city with FM stations all across the FM band from 87.7 up to 107.5 MHz. The radio was unable to separate ANY of these stations out and tune it in. I received nothing but 2 or more stations buried in static all simultaneously no matter where I tuned on the dial. This radio was unable to separate ANY station on the FM band. I live literally 9 blocks away from 2 FM radio stations and I could not receive either of those clearly (or any other station in town). FM selectivity on this radio was horrible. Overall, had poor sensitivity, poor selectivity, and horrible drift. I nearly had a very powerful FM station dialed in acceptably once but that only lasted for around 30 seconds; then it drifted off an needed to be re-tuned.Tuning and re-tuning is a bit of a pain that requires some patience. The needle has about 1/8"" play in it on either side of a target frequency so that if you are trying to tune a frequency, you by-pass it back and forth quite a bit before landing on it right. Then after a few seconds, when it begins to drift, you get to play the 1/8"" back and forth tuning game again until you find the freq. again.The speaker on this radio is probably on the level of what you can expect with a light, plastic radio with a speaker this size. I was NOT impressed at all with this speaker and didn\'t see how it sounded any better than the speaker on mySangean DT-300-VW Pocket-Sized Digital Radio with Tuner. The Kaito did get a little louder than the Sangean because the speaker is slightly larger; however, it did not sound more clear or better in any way. The sound via earbuds is better on my Sangean pocket radio. This Kaito\'s audio seems to lack bass frequencies and the lower mid-range. The Sangean pocket radio has very well balanced sound through the heahphone jack--in fact, it might be SLIGHTLY better than my expensive Sony ICF-SW7600GR. The Sony has better sound via the headphone jack than this Kaito does also--but it should since it\'s 5 times more expensive.Overall, the radio felt a bit fragile in comparison to both my Sony ICF-SW7600GR and my Sangean DT300VW pocket radio. It felt as if I could have easily crushed it or cracked it by accident. I could be unfarily judging this radio but I would hesitate before taking this radio out with me on a hike, bike ride, bus ride, etc. It just doesn\'t feel solid or durable. This radio is much smaller than my Sony and slightly larger than my Sangean pocket radio making it too small to use seriously for radio listening and too large to use as a pocket radio.I\'ve returned the Kaito WRX911 radio for a refund.RESOLUTION NOTE: As far as Amazon.com is concerned, I emailed their customer service and notified them that I had not received the carrying case that was supposed to be included. Since the item was sold by Kaito and not Amazon, they could not replaced the carrying case for me so they instead gave me a FULL REFUND...immediately. Within 24 hours after contacting customer service, I had a refund. This product was below my expectations; but Amazon was above them. Amazon has great customer service and a very easy and helpful return policy. I will continue to shop with Amazon.com',)"

"('Just received my Creative 512 MB MuVo N200 package yesterday.  Opened it up, checked out the contents and made sure everything was there.  Surprisingly, the package included one fresh battery.  This was great since I had just bought some rechargeables that were still charging.Out of a habit with all software, I went to Creative\'s website to find all updates.  I\'m glad that the instruction book wasn\'t a thick one, it just came with a Quick Start guide.  I think they have the official instruction book on their website for you to download or on the CD.  I just didn\'t want to spend the time to look for it.I put the cover on the MP3 player, which nicely fits together.  I plugged the USB cable that came with it to my computer and the MP3 player.  Automatically, the computer detected the MuVo as a removeable drive.  I went through my MP3 files, dragging and dropping, and picked the ones I wanted to listen to at the time.My collection of MP3s are mainly 192kbps, nothing lower than 128kbps and probably a dozen songs recorded at 256kbps.  So, I was able to store approximately... oh I forget right now, definitely more than 60 songs but I doubt more than 100 songs stored.  I do remember not being able to store anymore at approximately 450-460MB... take into consideration of system files and that the file system is formatted with FAT (not the most efficient available).It\'s amazing how many language you can choose from, I have tons of songs that are non-English.  I guess most MP3 players support multiple languages though... I don\'t see how this could NOT be an option for other MP3 players.After downloading all the songs I wanted and could fit on the player, I went to the gym to work out.  The armband worked great, the sound quality was very good and accessing the buttons was convenient.The setting has a neat function:  I switch from FM radio to music files every-now-and-then.  The player remembers the last function you access.  So if I am listening to FM radio and decide to avoid the commercial, I press the button and immediately presented with the MUSIC feature.  Vice versa.  I do not even need to look at what I\'m pressing the button for... totally awesome.The volume is very decent, I set it at halfway across the bar to reach a loud volume.I did not believe in any MP3 players before, until recently, when I decided that I should get one while I worked out at the gym and bike ride.  Now I might not leave home without it.Oh, I haven\'t used the recorder or mic... not sure if I am interested in that stuff, at least not right now.  I am interested in the ""encoding"" feature that MuVo offers.  I can convert CD music directly with my MuVo from what I understand.  Not sure if that will be efficient because it takes only a few seconds to convert a song on my computer.Off subject:  I saw one of those 40GB IPODS at the gym... super thin looking and very nice!This is definitely a keeper!',)"

"('Headphone preferences are matched only by partisan politics in producing controversy.  My hope is that by limiting the comparison to Sennheiser, I won\'t hear from irate Grado owners.  But regardless of the listener\'s headphones, the sound can be no better than the source.  It\'s absurd to compare headphones if you\'re listening to compressed MP3 files (about 1/8 the frequency response of full, non-compressed files) or to the numerous home theater amplifiers that doctor the sound with all sorts of artificial effects.  Besides a full-fidelity recording you\'ll need a high-quality amp with the ability to bypass all equalization and effects.  Secondly, you\'ll need a recording by an engineer who doesn\'t goose the bass or alter the sound of piano , horns, and drums to suit his own tastes or a ""house style.""  I went to some recordings engineered by Roy DuNann who, while working for Lester Koenig\'s Contemporary label, produced recordings of transparency, detail and, above all, of absolute ""fidelity"" to the original source.The EH-150s, perhaps not surprisingly, produced the ""biggest"" sound, with resonance and presence to spare along with the most ""sealed in"" quality of the three in question.  The downside is that they are slightly tight and large, not ideal for extended, uninterrupted use.  The bass is noisy compared to the studio\'s Sony MDR-7506 phones or my Koss-UR40s. The big question is why Sennheiser removed from their line-up the popular HD-497s, which appear to have been replaced by the EH-150s.The CX-300s are, as a popular consumer\'s magazine recently reported, potentially the equal of ear-buds ten times the price.  But it depends on many variables, from the size of the earpiece, to the degree of insertion, to the seal (some buds advise the use of a paste-like substance).  They provide excellent treble and surprising bass (though the frequency range quickly pales alongside the EH-150s in a noisy environment).  Also, the uneven cable lengths (short to the left bud) take some getting used to (Sennheiser recommends that you wear the cable behind your neck). Sennheiser thoughtlessly neglected to provide a small sack or similar container for the extra four coverings (Sony is more conscientious about this detail).The PX-100s, though slighly less expensive than the EH-150s, get my vote.  The drums and bass may lack some of the resonance, fire and pop of the comparable instruments rendered by the EH-150s, but they compensate for ""bigness"" by their outstanding, accurate, nuanced reproductive detail, from every whispered brush stroke to the definitive, revelatory realism of Scottie LaFaro\'s walking bass.  Their lightness and pleasing sound are not the least of their attributes, making it possible to wear them for a longer period of time than any competing headphones, whether full-sized or ear buds.The downside is the thinness of the two wires extended from each phone and the extra time required to fold and unfold them when placing them in their hard case.  (When I\'m in a rush, I grab my Koss Portapros which, if priced at fifteen or more bucks lower than the PX100\'s, are probably the better value).In sum, when at the radio station I prefer the Koss UR-40s but am not too upset in going to the station\'s own more durable Sony MDR-7506s.  At home, or on the road or in flight, I prefer the Sennheiser PX100s, though when I don\'t have that extra minute to spare I\'m scarcely less happy to grab the Koss PortaPros.  Ear buds of any type are for ""emergency use"" only--when space is not merely at a premium but virtually non-existent.',)"
"(""This is my 4th router, and it's by far the best one.  The previous one I had was a D-Link.  The one before that - Linksys.  And my first one was a Netgear.  Netgear was just plain bad.  Maybe it's because it was one of the first ones in its line.  Maybe it was something else.  I don't know... and I don't care.  I got rid of it fast, and got myself a Linksys.  For the most part, I was pretty happy with it.  The setup was fairly easy and pretty straight forward.  A few questions/problems that I've had over time that I owned it, were answered by Linksys support in professional and timely manner.  It was a nice and reliable product.  But the time came to upgrade it, and I decided to try something new.  D-Link was my next choice.  The router itself also wasn't bad, although the setup was a bit more challenging, and the product itself was not as user-friendly as Linksys.  I would probably still keep it, despite a few minor inconveniences.  What finally made me give it up and look for another one was D-Link's support, which is virtually non-existent and useless for the most part.  I own several different D-Link's products, and they are all not bad products, but god forbid you have a problem - you'll have to jump through hoops to get help, and in the end will have to solve the problem yourself anyway... but that's another story.  Let's get back to this Belkin router.  I did a lot of research before going with Belkin.  A few things that made me make a final decision were the fact that it comes with a built in USB Print Server, and that it also supports Windows Connect Now technology.  Here is a little summary of what I like about Belkin and why I recommend it to other people:Setup - Like a walk in a park...  Fast and painless.  Especially if you are upgrading from another router.  Like I already mentioned, it supports Windows Connect Now technology through its' USB port.  I saved my wireless settings (using Wireless Network Wizard on my Windows XP SP2 laptop) to a USB flash drive, and then just plugged it into the USB port on Belkin router.  That's it.  In a few seconds the settings were saved, and I was all set.  If you don't have another router, it's not that bad either.  Just follow the wizard from the included installation CD, and you'll be up and running in no time.  Then, you can also take advantage of Windows Connect Now - plug USB flash drive into the router's USB port to save the settings on it, and then easily add any number of computers/others products to the network.  Beautiful, isn't it?!  Print Server installation was just as easy.  I have a 5 in 1 printer/scanner/fax machine from Brother (model MFC 3100C), and it worked like a charm.  Using the same installation CD, I followed the steps, and in 2 minutes I was sending jobs wirelessly to my printer.  Totally awesome!Performance - Beats any other router that I've had/tried.  I would highly recommend though to use it in conjunction with Belkin card (I got Belkin Wireless G Card F5D7011) to get the most out of the router's capabilities.  It's probably 25% faster than the D-Link that I had before.Features - I'm going to repeat myself here, but where else are you going to find a router that has a built-in print server, supports Windows Connect Now, and has the speed of up to 125Mbps, not to mention VPN support and Mac compatibility.  Belkin is the one.Web Interface - Like I said before, this is my 4th router.  Prior to this one, I would probably say that Linksys had the best and most user-friendly web browser interface.  Belkin's is just as good.  It's very self-explanatory and easy to use.  Great Help is available too.Support - I have not had any problems so far, so I have yet to contact Belkin support and can't really say if they are good or bad.  I have heard from other people though that they  are excellent.To summarize everything that's already been said, I think it's a great router.  In fact, for the price, you get two products in one - a router, and a print server.  Nice deal, indeed.Tips - Here is a few pointers for a smooth installation:1.  If you are installing a network card adapter (which I highly recommend you do, check out Belkin F5D7011 card) together with a router, make sure you install and configure the router first.  Trust me on this one.2.  When installing/configuring Print Server, make sure you have your printer drivers already installed.That's it.  Enjoy!"",)"

"('Chose Sirius for content reasons, after shopping extensively for Sirius PNP receivers, chose the JVC unit for the following reasons:-- small size ""PDA style"" -- can fit in your pocket-- super bright/readable screen -- crisp \'red LED\' on black background-- wanted a second generation receiver from mfr who had first gen experience (JVC 2000 supersedes 1000)-- reputation for very good antenna-- rumor that soon-to-be release boombox will be superbI was not disappointed.  Installed in car with antenna on dash and experienced very few drop outs despite less than optimal antenna location.  Did notice a bit of hiss with the integral FM modulator, so opted for direct connection to my ""MP3"" Aux input on the car stereo... beautiful sound with the direct connection.  Screen indeed readable in bright sunlight.  Channel/category switch on the unit a bit clunky (though buttons on remote are fine = ""real buttons"")... other than this I\'m highly satisfied. The 18 presets on the unit more than enough for me and suction cup dash/window mount that comes with the car kit seems bulletproof and very tight (especially vs. double-stick tape approach with other units).  Nice thing about the PDA form factor when used in the car is that it\'s easy to slip in your pocket if leaving the car in a theft-prone area.  Unit runs warm but nowhere near as hot as I thought it might given other online comments.Sirius programming seems a bit more oriented to older demographic vs. XM.  I liked (1) extensive news including PBS/BBC/PRI/World, (2) reggae/tropical/vacation channels, (3) tighter music genres in general (vs. more thematic on XM)... and in 2006 am looking forward to Howard Stern\'s move from FM to Sirius.  Only programming on XM not on Sirius that I miss is MSNBC.  Also note that Sirius traffic/weather is slightly less convenient since they put two cities on each channel, cycling coverage through each.Looking forward to getting the boombox for the JVC KT-SR2000 soon... this appears to be simple, clean aesthetically (would look ok at home) and has a bass-boost capability... a/c adapter and antenna with 20\' cord included.',)"
"('If you have a DC power adapter which starts buzzing and making noise - that means it is failing and it needs to be replaced.  This seems to be a pretty well-made, universal replacement for most DC adapters.  It doesn\'t seem shoddily made, and so I\'d expect it\'ll last a good long time.The most important thing you need to know is that there is really no such thing as a truly ""universal"" DC adapter.  So while this will probably work for most people in most applications, if you want to avoid disappointment, do yourself a favor, and take five minutes to answer the questions below.  All this information SHOULD be on the back of the DC adapter you are replacing, although it is often in painfully small print and difficult to read.(1) Does the voltage on the old adapter match one of the settings on this new adapter?  (6v, 9v, etc.)(2) Can you tell which part of the tip of the old adapter is carrying positive voltage now?  Most, but not all adapters should have a little diagram showing you which part of the tip carries the positive voltage.  If it isn\'t on the adapter, the diagram is sometimes right on the device itself, showing what needs to be plugged into it.  If you can\'t figure it out, you have a 50% chance of sending the power down the wrong side of the tip, which could conceivably just fry your device.  And no, nobody but you is going to pay for fixing the thing you killed by setting this up wrong. So it is pretty important to figure this out and get it right.(3) Does the existing device need less than 1.5 Amps of power?  The DC adapter you are replacing should say on the back exactly how many amps it draws (or you can figure it out yourself using the amps, watts, volts equation - just search for it if you don\'t know how to do this yourself - there are free calculators out there on the internet).  If it turns out that the device draws 1.5 Amps or less, you are all set.Once you get it, the setup is fairly simple.  You find the tip that fits your device, then figure out which way it should be attached to the cord (you select which part of the tip carries the positive voltage by which side of the wire you plug it into).  It is pretty clearly labeled as to which side is the center and you just align that with the + or - on the sides of the wire.  Then set the voltage to match the old adapter, using the sliding switch.  Fortunately, the switch is of pretty high-quality and it takes some effort to move it, so it isn\'t likely to slip to a different voltage accidentally in normal use.  Then you are done.  Go plug it in.  No muss, no fuss.  For me, it seems to work just fine in replacing the original adapter.It has a pretty wide selection of tips, which should work for most devices, but take the time to look carefully at the picture on here and the tip of your existing adapter to make sure you aren\'t trying to replace anything weird looking.  Note that the diameter of the tips doesn\'t get huge for the round, barrel-shaped tips that are most commonly used.  I had a perfectly normal-sized diameter thing to replace, and it took the most fat tip on the set.  There are certainly some adapters out there that would take a thicker diameter than what is offered here.  Probably most of those are for higher power adapters that this low amp device couldn\'t replace anyway, but I am sure there are at least a few situations where you will still pass all the questions above, but none of the tips will work for you.  This is a very good reason to buy it from Amazon, where they will take things back without any nonsense.',)"

"('Listening to my Four Tops songs on my iTunes, I\'m hearing some odd channel separations that I don\'t know if it\'s the fault of the headphones or of the way they mixed the CD.  The harpsichord is so prominent now on ""If I Were A Carpenter"" where before it was more in the background. This is a good thing! Makes it seem like a whole new song. The majestic French horn in ""What is a Man"" is glorious to behold now.All that is important because I never thought I could get this kind of quality from small, semi-portable headphones. Mind you, it has its limitations, after a point if you crank the volume there is naturally some muddiness, but it\'s nothing even a picky person like me can\'t live with.I was encouraged to buy them by the good reviews, but I\'ve owned Koss before, with my first being in the form of the classic RadioShack Pro60 headphones. For years I had the Koss UR20 headphones for my television set. This is the first time I\'ve gotten smaller ones.Earbuds are a disaster for me, frustrating to keep on and painful to keep in. Not so with this sportsclip style. I barely even notice them on, except of course, when I suddenly get up to go do something and am strangled by the cord! (Extension cord...a good thing!) But that mercilessly short three-foot cord suggests it was probably designed for the treadmill crowd, however I see no reason why you can\'t use them at work or at home, like I plan to. They\'re very easy to use. You put them on just as if you were putting on eyeglasses, in fact I wear mine OVER my glasses. They don\'t mess up your hair, either, although mine will occasionally get caught.I bought mine at CC because I had more than my fill of the around-the-back-of-the-head phones I was using on my work computer and I destroyed them, so I had to rush to get a replacement. There is NO working without my music, I\'m sorry! As a result, I paid more for them, but I knew that this way I could easily return them if I didn\'t like them. I bought two more from Amazon.com rather than the other seller they list here at a lower price, because I wanted to be sure to get it in a timely manner.I recommend Koss KSC75s very highly. As I write this, I\'m using the Dance setting on the iTunes equalizer, and you ought to hear Jamerson\'s bass lines on ""Still Water (Love)""!  I can\'t wait to hear what they\'re like after they\'ve broken in.',)"

"('My review of the Lowepro Pro Runner 350 AW camera backpack.  In a word, wonderful!  In two words: five stars!The minute the Lowepro arrived my wife began eying the bag.  In nothing flat she was unzipping it, looking at all the compartments, and telling me all the things she could use it for. She was amazed at the number of pockets, and she commented on how everything was padded. I icily pointed out that it was for camera use only.  Something tells me my dinner will be frosty for a night or two.  So what, it is going to be worth it.  I\'ll hide the knives.I unloaded my old camera bag and placed my Olympus into the new Lowepro bag.  There was lots of room, and everything that I had stuffed into my old bag easily fit into the Pro Runner 350 AW.  The central camera area has adjustable Velcro compartments that are heavily padded. The Velcro is super good.  I know `cause it took me quite a tug to get the compartment adjusters ripped out.  For a fellow with arthritis the tug hurts a bit, but once the dividers were into their new positions I was glad they were firmly in. The Pro Runner also has room for your Laptop, (yes, a laptop computer), cell phone, pens, documents, small tripod, and a host of other items including keys. I think I can easily find a spot for my aspirin. All six bottles.The carrying straps are padded beyond belief, and there is a waist belt to hold it firmly on your back. And there is, of course, a carrying handle.  Not just any carrying handle, but a rubberize handle with plenty of width for my extra large sized hand - swollen knuckles and all.  No gloves needed to carry this baby.  It feels good in the hand.OK, so how do I know the bag will protect the camera?  That is, after all, its key job.  Well, it is heavily padded, the zippers are super wide (plus they zip and unzip easily), and they seem to be super tough.  Not the kind of zipper that is going to rip open or unzip due to being flung about.But, there is nothing like a test.  So I went to the top of my stairs with the bag, loaded with my camera and all its gear, and tossed it down the stairs.  The bottom of the stairs in my place is a tile floor.  The bag bounced nicely down the stairs and onto the tile below.  I also dropped the bag by holding it at arm\'s length over my head and letting it go.  Another nice bounce.I opened the bag and had a look.  The camera\'s lens cover had popped off, but no other changes.  Nothing moved at all in any of the camera compartments, and even my keys and pens stayed put.  Also, I have to give the bag points for not allowing any dog hair into its compartments.  After it hit the bottom of the stairs it was covered in dog hair - big time.  My wife will hear about this!  Errr... maybe not.  One crisis at a time.Ok, now to the negative.  One must lay long lenses down in the bag.  This will not be a problem if they are fat lenses, but narrow ones will leave a gap between the top of the compartment and the lens.  Just put something in that will stop any movement and it should be fine.  My camera bounced within its compartment, I think, and that is the reason the lens cap popped off.  Still, not a really big difficulty.  A small towel or washcloth could solve that dilemma in a flash.  The Velcro compartment dividers are hard to rip out and put back in.  This will not be a problem for a photographer like myself who keeps the same equipment for decades, but it will be a pain for anyone who wants to change the compartments a lot... do you hear that honey?  Of course, the company had to make them hard to jar loose, so that is just the price of quality in this particular system.  The bag is black, which is fine in many many ways.  Black makes it hard for a thief to determine that it is a camera bag, unlike the silver cases.  Those silver cases just scream ""steal me.""  The problem with the black bag is it shows the dog hair like you can\'t believe!  Where did she hide the vacuum?I like the bag!  No, my wife is not going to get it for cosmetics or anything else.  A camera bag it is, and a camera bag it will stay.  I just hope she can\'t find a way to get it anyway.... No, I don\'t have life insurance...AD2',)"
"('I purchased these from a local retailer (Audio Perfection in Minneapolis, MN).  Grado is all they carry, so I could have any headphone I wanted, as long it was from Grado :-)  Really, they were quite insistent on this point and talked me into a lengthy audition session.So, I came back to the store with my MacBook Pro (late 2010 model) with NuForce uDac-2 DAC fed by Channel D\'s Pure Music audio engine and a collection of Apple Lossless tracks (Redbook and high-resolution).  I\'ve since upgraded to the asynchronous USB model (which is a surprising improvement - you can read my review of the NuForce uDAC-2SE for details):NuForce Icon uDAC-2 (Red) Special Edition (with Asynchronous USB)The salesman from Audio Perfection in Minneapolis (Eric - a great guy) brought out three Grado models:1. Prestige Series SR325is Headphones2. RS-2i3. RS-1iOf course, every good salesman knows that the customer will always go for the middle-priced model - which is what I did :-)  That aside, I spent about an hour and a half listening to the above headphones with my laptop, while Eric setup a movie for my daughter to watch in another room.The SR325is cans weren\'t bad, but they are simply outclassed by the other two models - the difference is immediately obvious and one doesn\'t need more than a few seconds of listening to pick the winner.The RS-2i and RS-1i are close in sound quality - both sets have incredible definition, separation of instruments, tight, fast-attacking bass and great sibilance.  The clarity of the vocals was something I\'ve never heard before in a headphone.  In fact, when friends listen to these, that is usually the comment I hear: ""...I can really understand the lyrics..."".But, as other reviewers have pointed out, the difference just wasn\'t enough to push me into an additional $200.00 for the RS-1i - so I went for the RS-2i.This was a few months ago and the headphones sound as great now as they did then - no buyers remorse, whatsoever.  However, I\'ve stopped using them at work and went back to my Bose QC-15 cans.  For active listening, the Bose models sound like muffled dixie cups - really, it\'s sad to compare the two, side-by-side.  If you are reading this and thinking: ""...oh, here\'s another guy bashing Bose..."", I challenge you to listen and compare with a pair of high-end headphones (Sennheiser, Grado, Audio Technica, whatever).But I really need the noise canceling at client sites and the Grados are an open air design - all sound comes out and all sound goes in from the surrounding environment.  You need to be aware of this if you are going to use these in an office environment for background listening.Worse, however, is the comfort level - the Grado cans simply hurt after a couple of hours.  My ears get sore and the top of my head gets irritated by the headband.  The Bose QC-15s are wearable for 8 hours at a time.  I\'ve worn these for many overseas flights and wear them for 4 hours at a time while working.So, 5 stars for the Grado RS-2i on the sound quality, but be aware of their limitations for background listening over long periods.',)"
"('On recent transatlantic trips, I took the following three pairs of noise-cancelling headphones: my wife\'s original Sony MDR-NC1 (I believe), theSony MDRNC22/BLK Noise Canceling Earbuds, and the Sennheisers I am reviewing. I bought the latter (refurbished) as I have been extremely happy with the sound quality of my trustySennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones, which my daughter claims are an extension of my body.Active noise cancellation, by its very nature, works best on low-pitched, monotonous sounds (like airplane engine noise). Do not expect it to do much against crying children, loud female conversations (baritone and especially basso male voices are suppressed somewhat), sirens,... In fact, I could understand my female flight attendant BETTER with the noise cancellation on the PXC250 turned on, because the droning engine noise wasn\'t covering her up.The Sony\'s are both in-ear earphones, and if the flanges fit snugly you get passive noise blocking on top of the active cancellation. The old Sony\'s do best overall in this regard, followed by the MDR-NC22s; the Sennheisers, which are closed on-ear types, give decent active cancellation and just a little bit of passive blocking (if you position them carefully on your ear). This is a minus when trying to ""block out"" noisy people around you, but a plus when walking on the street as you are still aware of your surroundings.Also, noise cancelling headphones always seem to entail sacrifices in sounds quality. The MDR-NC22 are overall best rated as ""tolerable""; the old MDR-NC1 just okay, not great; I find these Sennheisers actually fairly pleasant to listen to, at least with the cancellation/sound enhancement circuitry turned on. Still, I\'m not giving away my open-air PX 100s, as these still do better (as will any high-quality ""conventional"" pair of headphones).Comfort depends on the person: I can wear these for hours without being bothered by them, while I tend to find in-ear earphones uncomfortable for extended wearing. Your mileage may vary, and also will be a function of what you find less annoying: objects splaying your ear canal or obnoxiously loud neighbors on the plane/subway/train/....The refurbished unit I got functions like new. It came with a convenient carrying pouch (with a belt loop), which also holds my iPod Nano now. I keep 4 AAA batteries in the outer pouch, but battery life of the unit is pretty impressive: I\'m still on the 1st pair of batteries and they have been going for 30+ hours now.On the whole, if you can\'t deal with in-ear earphones and can\'t afford to spend US$350 on Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones or US$450 onSennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise Canceling Headphones, these may be a good buy, especially at the Amazon price.',)"
"(""Just like any dog, you have to understand it's quirks. If using for functions other than the barking, you might appreciate it more.  As others have described, the 3rd level of 'frenzy' barking is not at all realistic, and it is very difficult/impossible to keep the unit functioning at the one or two-bark level before it jets off into uncontrollable noise.  Actually, the barking mode does not appear to be intended for detection of an object that continues to stand in the same place.  It is intended for a person passing by.  If you pass by it, it can bark once; if you delay, then it will get more agitated with multiple barks, and if you stay very long, it *will* make an incessant annoying noise that does not sound like a dog.  If you want to use this like a dog, you have to put it somewhere that people will pass by on their way to your door.  And then you will not have the effect of a dog barking at an intruder at your door; but at least there will be a bark along the way.  The unit says there will be different sensitivity in different weather, perhaps rain, etc.  I think I have experienced that quirk also.  If you want it to work right under different conditions, then the battle for adjusting sensitivity begins anew.  Sorry about that.The unit does not see through walls either.  I had to find a window with no screen to put it behind.And the only way that I could actually set it up was to buy a remote on/off switch, and power the unit off while I was adjusting it.  Setup is tricky because it will bark 5 seconds after you turn it on, and you think you have just triggered it with your presence.  You have to ignore that bark.  And while you are near it making adjustments, it goes into frenzy mode because you have been detected for too long.  Turn it off to adjust it, then walk past it after it has been powered on for more than at least 5 seconds.  If you stand within it's range past the two-bark stage, it will sound like hell.  With an on/off remote switch you can at least shut it up.---I found an alternative that so far is meeting my needs.  It is theScytek MP Siren True Sound MP3 Player Siren.  I now notice also aGalaxy SRMP3 True Sound MP3 Player Siren.  The fake roar of theElectronic Secure Dog Barking Dog Alarmis just a nuisance. I suggest you see my review on the Scytek unit; it is difficult to set up.  Basically, in that setup I am using an IR Motion Controller to send signals to an X10 transceiver which sends signals to an appliance module connected to any electrical outlet in the house.  It's complicated.  So now I have a Scytke Siren that barks like a dog from a custom MP3 file, and that is happening in one part of the house, and I have a doorbell chime activated by the same signal in another part of the house.  I plan on putting in additional Motion Control sensors around the house.  And with multiple alarms, I could have different dog sounds barking all around the house.  In case you're wondering, I'm also the guy that put an electric fence shocker on my windows.  Now that's awesome!  I also have floodlights, sirens, and a camera if someone actually enters. How cool is that?"",)"

My company puts training in MP3 format and I can use this to listen to them.Pros:-It\'s 1G.  Although sometimes I feel like it\'s too little, it really makes me figure out what I really want to listen to, vs the 40GB Nomad which has ""everything"" so I never know what to listen to next.-It\'s a hard drive to your PC, so you can just drag and drop (and use as a hard drive).  What I do is build the folders on my PC and just drag and drop them on.-Although it doesn\'t support playlists, it does allow folders (only one level).-Many play modes including playing just one folder with repeat....other modes are common (shuffle, shuffle repeat, normal, repeat all, repeat song, a--b....)-The EQ is nice.-Navigation is fairly easy.-Sound is pretty good.  Never used the headphones that came with it. I use Shure E2Cs.  It also sounds pretty good using Grado SR-80s.-It\'s convenient for the car.  My car has an aux jack that goes right into the headphone.  I guess that\'s more a feature of my car than the N200.-LCD orientation can be right handed or left handed.  Although I\'m right handed, I find the left handed orientation more convenient.-FM Radio is decent.-It\'s small.  Sometimes, too small, but overall it\'s a good thing.-I haven\'t tried the inline MP3 encoding, but I do like the fact that it can encode at 160bps.  I find that 128bps really doesn\'t provide adequate quality.-Pretty easy to navigate especially between folders.  You just have to press the toggle and keep it down and it shows the folder.  From there you could go forward or backward by folder.Cons:-Within the folders, it\'ll play the songs in alphabetical order only.  You can get around it by numbering the songs in each folder.-The voice recording is very sensitive and is prone to any movement or background noise.-The battery door can fall off easily.-The rubber case takes away some of the nice design on the player.  But, it works pretty well.  And makes the battery door less prone to fall off.-There\'s no lanyard attachment to hang around your neck.  It does come with an armband, but I never got used to that.-To lock it you need to go through the menu.  It would have been nice if it was a switch.Issues:-Just recently, it started turning itself off intermittently.  Then, it got really bad and it would stay on for only a brief moment.  Sending an email to Creative Tech Support, they responded same day and suggested I upgrade the firmware to 1.12.01.  It fixed it.  It also fixed the buzzing problem when the light is on.  I never heard the crackling that others have heard (maybe I just wasn\'t paying enough attention).Overall, I\'m very happy with it.  Until it starting shutting itself off, I would say that I was extremely happy.  Since it only took upgrading the firmware to fix, I got over it.  I would highly recommend this player.  Look for rebates and a good price like here on Amazon and it is a pretty good value.',)"
"('What can I tell you that you haven\'t already heard or read? Explosive lowest bass frequencies, pure and clean midrange (vocals) and incredibly spacious and open sound in the high frequencies, but they never sound harsh. If you are getting any harshness or you are getting weak bass, look into your audio playback components and the file quality or the recording quality. The SR 225i model is a very revealing set of headphones and it will make any deficiencies in your system very obvious. These cans also need 100 hours of burn-in time to settle down with their high frequencies. The cymbals sound too loud right out of the box. Just let them play at normal volume for 100 hours and you\'ll be set.These are really great headphones and the best I\'ve ever owned so far. I will never buy a different brand. I used to be a die-hard Sennheiser fan for many, many years. I used to also enjoy some AKG models and even some Sony models, but then I tried the Grado SR80 in the winter of 2007 and I was stunned. I only then realized that other manufacturers cannot even hold a candle to Grado. Wow, I was suddenly deeply disappointed with Sennheiser and especially AKG. I used for SR80 and still use for SR225i my NAD Electronics Integrated Amplifier to power them via 1/4"" headphone jack and an NAD CD Player with the built-in 24-bit Burr-Brown DAC. An awesome combination that could maybe even be improved with a good quality tube headphone amplifier. I will consider that in the future.I enjoyed the Grado SR80 model very much for about 18 months, but then I decided to upgrade in the summer of 2009. I wanted to explore and see what\'s possible further up the Prestige line with the SR225i model. I expected better sound, even more bass in the lowest frequencies and even clearer and more open sound in the high frequencies. Well, I got all those things in spades. I couldn\'t believe it. The further up the line you go and the more money you spend, the more improvements you experience in the sound and the build quality.Sennheiser and AKG are certainly NOT like that. They are all over the map and many times a more expensive pair of cans will give you much lower sound quality. Really disappointing. I will stay with Grado as long as they keep making these colossal performers. These are incredibly transparent and truly high-fidelity headphones and that\'s why they demand the best file quality, a good DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and some decent amplification in order to show you what they can do. It\'s kind of like a Ferrari. You can\'t just put a generic, 4-cylinder engine inside and some narrow, no-name tires on it and expect the best performance and cornering out of it.Please AVOID MP3 and AAC files and give these cans some CD quality files or better. CDs are encoded at 1400 kbps (kilobits per second) while the best MP3s are encoded at 256 and 320 kbps. That\'s a huge difference and you can clearly hear the difference in the bass and the high frequencies. You can even get \'better than CD\' quality files on line. Just do a quick search on line for \'HD music downloads\' and see the possibilities. Those \'HD\' files are 24-bit files while music CDs give you only 16-bit files at 1400 kbps. Again, a big difference.DO NOT skimp on the FILE QUALITY, AMPLIFICATION and the DAC.These three components are very important if you are trying to get the best sound possible out of these. The CD quality file should be the bare minimum you should consider with these cans. Dedicated headphone amplifiers are widely available and some of them even have DACs already built in them. Although the specs say these are 32 Ohm cans, don\'t fall for that. These cans need some serious juice to get them really going in the high frequencies and midrange, to get the best and cleanest bass, to get the lowest bass and to get the full potential out of them in all segments of their performance. Again, why? Because these are very high performance cans and they can achieve the sound quality way better than any big box store pair of headphones in any price range. I just laugh when people mention Beats by Dr. Dre.Beats by WHO? Get the bell outta here and give me some Grados, will ya?',)"
"(""I was lucky I found the skyfi 2 this past weekend at a local store.The Skyfi 2 is an improvement in the Skyfi 1 in many ways.The Skyfi 2 has better sound and can be played in your existing car and home boombox cradle.From the beginning you will notice the sound is louder on this one than it is on the skyfi 1.I don't have to cut the volume up as loud now on my boombox as I did with my skyfi 1.The Skyfi 2 also comes with a brighter light for viewing during sunny weather.I can actually see this now when the sun is bright in my car I can still read it.The skyfi 2 has a choice of 2 colors.Black on White which is recommended when driving in bright sunlight or White On Black which looks kind of blue and not as bright but you can still adjust the brightness on both colors in the menu screen.This thing is really bright at night unless you lower the brightness.The Skyfi 2 also has a sport and stock ticker.You can see sports scores or stocks scrolling under the artist and song info.I'm hoping Delphi will add weather as well to this.The skyfi 2 is the first reciever to feature extended titles.If you have the scroll on which is in the menu the song will start out at 16 characters but go to 30 something depending on song.Note the scroll for extended titles isn't the same thing as having the artist and song scroll across in big letters.The scroll for extended titles is in the menu you can cut it on or off it just scrolls the longer titles to extended ones.The song artist big letter scroll is in the display mode you can pick between this and other ways to see the song artist info.This makes the reciever look better similar to Sirius reciever.The skyfi 2 also has a unique feature.It has an Fm modulator inside the unit.When you put it in your car cradle it will turn on.You can cut it off in the menu if you want to but this thing has over 6-12 frequencies.It features the lower frequencies 88-89 and the higher ones 106-107.This thing sounds much better than my wired mod in my car.Also this unit features a record feature.You do nothing it automatically records from the time you cut it on.This is a first for an xmreciever.Also you could put 20 favorite stations in the skyfi 1 you can put 30 in this one.Here is a summery of this unit.Also you can view info 4 ways on the reciever.You can still activate it to scroll in big letters if your at a distance.You can have just the song and artist like the skyfi 1 featured,You can have artist,song and stocks or you can choose artist,song and sports.Pro'sExtended Titles-This is the only xm reciever to feature this but it will eventually be available in newer models too.XM is just starting to get into listing more than 16 characters for artist and song.Brighter Light for viewing in bright sunlight.It doesn't get washed out.Stock Tickers and Sports Scores Note you must go into the menu and pick your favorite stocks and sports teams.Better SoundBuilt In Fm Modulator and it lets you choose over 6 frequencies.Also although xm recommends you buy the new car cradle it works fine with the old car cradle.30 Presets features A,B and C were you can put at least 10 channels on each.Pause and Record Feature-The Skyfi 2 automatically starts to record when you cut it on.You don't have to do anything not even pause.If you want to hear a song again that you liked real good or missed when you was away from the reciever you can just hit the reverse arrow.It can hold up to 30 minutes of songs.You can also go foward by hitting the foward arrow.If you want to hear live programming what is playing now just hold the foward arrow it will then beep and display live on the top.Note once you cut it off all memory will be lost.When you cut it back on it starts to record again from the first song.This is a great feature to have if your reciever is in the house and you have to go outside for something.When you come back in you can just push the back arrow and go back to the songs.And the recorded songs sound live you can't tell a difference in sound quality.You can also pause the music if you want to.The Skyfi 2 features a clock.You can either view it in 12 or 24 hr time.The Skyfi 2 can also alert you when your favorite artist or song is on.For example if your favorite artist on Sunny channel 24 is Percy Faith if your on another channel you will hear a beep when they play Percy Faith.You can put at least 10 favorite artist or songs in.The Skyfi 2 is lighter than the Skyfi 1.Even thou their the same size the Skyfi 2 isn't as heavy as the Skyfi 1.The Skyfi 2 comes with a remote.Note the skyfi 1's remote will also work on the skyfi 2 if you want to cut up or down the volume,change channel or put in numbers.The sky 2's remote has additionel keys and different batteries.ConsIt doesn't feature a variety of colors for your mood like the roady 2 does.Even thou it says you can pick it up on any Fm radio inside the house you can't.The Fm mod only works on the car cradle.It's not in the menu when it's on the boombox.The sky 2 remote is heavier and takes 2 aa battaries instead of a long life lithium like the sky 1 remote.Also the sky 2 remote is slightley larger than the sky 1.The skyfi 2 is worth the extra money.I highley recommend it.I also recommend the protective satellite radio reciever case which is cheap to keep this in.It will protect the lcd screen from scratches.Also Xm has an emergency channel on 247 which monitors tornadoes,hurricanes,volcanos,floods,blizzards etc.It came in handy this past summer with the Florida Hurricanes and this Fall with the eruption of Mount Saint Helens.They give evacuation routes,watches,warnings,school and business closings and other info.This is yet another reason to get xm."",)"
"('The ""remanufactured"" Rio Karma represents an incredible bargain for a product that in many ways remains unique among digital audio music players. Potential buyers should realize, however, that Rio is no longer making DAP\'s, having succumbed to the stiff competition represented by Apple\'s iPod devices.  Consequently, if you purchase a Karma today you should be prepared for a virtual lack of product support from Rio.First, the good news. The Karma has considerable storage capacity, excellent sound quality (including a customizable EQ function, something that iPods lack), and a clear, intuitive navigation system that is easy to learn.  It also is (almost) unique among digital audio players in that it will play \'gaplessly\', meaning that if your music is formatted in separate tracks but is meant to play continuously between these tracks (such as in the medley sequence in the Beatles\' ""Abbey Road"" or in Pink FLoyd\'s ""Dark Side of the Moon""), the music will be reproduced as the musicians intended.  By contrast, with the iPods or practically any other digital player, there will invariably be a small (or large!) gap between tracks, something that to some of us is quite annoying.  For me, this function is extremely important, as some of my favorite music is delivered in the form of nonstop dj mixes.  Gaps between tracks are simply a ""no-no"" for me.  As long as the music is ripped and encoded using a high-quality program (I use Exact Audio Copy coupled with the LAME Mp3 encoder), these mixes play gaplessly.  Fabulous!No digital player provides for every single encoding system, or ""codec,"" but the Karma is more versatile than most.  It plays the standard Mp3 files, and also files prepared in the public domain, high quality Ogg Vorbis format.  Furthermore, it will play Microsoft\'s WMA files, and if highest quality is desired, it provides for an excellent uncompressed format, FLAC. The Karma does NOT play the AAC files that are favored within the iPod system, however, so if users plan to rip music for use on both a Karma and an iPod, it\'s best to stick to Mp3.The Karma comes with a very useful docking device that not only enables the unit to be recharged, it connects to one\'s computer for ""synchronizing,"" i.e., transferring and managing music files. The dock also includes white and red outlets for standard stereo RCA jacks, making it simple to connect the Karma to a larger home stereo system.Overall, the Karma, while perhaps a bit squarish and squat-looking, is highly functional and easy to use.  At the prices offered on these refurb units, it\'s a veritable steal.So what\'s the bad news?  First of all, the Karma has always been plagued by problems of build quality.  The units are fairly delicate, so it\'s a good idea to keep the Karma in a case of some kind for protection.  Second, because the Karma is now a defunct product that never reached popularity even close to that of the iPods, there are far fewer accessories and add-ons than are available for the Apple units, and those that were made are becoming scarcer by the day.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this offer is clearly a case of *caveat emptor*, as even with a scant 30-day warranty it\'s virtually impossible at this point to receive any support from Rio.  I had a problem with my own refurb Karma not long ago when the unit was consistently not recognized by the computer, i.e., the included Rio Music Manager software. I thought my Karma might be defective, so I contacted Rio.  I got no response whatsover.  Only by sleuthing through the remaining material still posted on the Rio web site, including some useful ""FAQ\'s"" was I able to learn that the Karma usually needs to be connected directly to a computer USB port, rather than even a powered USB hub.  I made this adjustment and I\'ve had no problems since then.  But the point here is that for product support buyers are largely on their own.  There remain a few online user forums where intrepid Karma loyalists share information, but as time goes on the rate of participation in these discussions will continue to wane.Finally: some potential buyers might be wary of purchasing any kind of ""refurbished"" machine, whether it be a music player, a digital camera, or an inkjet printer.  The fact is, however, that usually (not always!) these are reliable units not particularly prone to breakdowns.  With most companies, refurbs represent units that have been returned to sellers *for any reason*.  Usually it\'s just that the purchaser changed his or her mind about wanting the product.  In those cases where there was something wrong, the manufacturer is pledged to fix the problem. All refurbs are checked over and tested before they are resold. Consequently, some people actually claim that there is LESS chance of getting a lemon with a refurbished unit than with a new one.  I don\'t know about this, but my own experience with refurbished machines has been good.  There might be a small cosmetic blemish on the Karma, but you can be pretty certain (notice I didn\'t say ""totally"") that it will function properly out-of-the-box.I like my Karma.  I like the gapless playback, I like the sound quality (which is, to my ears, superior to that of my iPod), and I like the layout of the controls.  The Rio software is not quite as elegant as Apple\'s iTunes, but it\'s certainly adequate.  I consider my refurbished Karma to have been a bargain, and I might buy another one for the inevitable day when my trusty Karma gives up the proverbial ghost.  If I go to a second Karma, I still will have paid no more than I would have paid for a single iPod.  Not a bad deal at all.',)"

"('A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, I had purchased a Rio Forge Sport 256 MB MP3 Player. Someone must have slipped me a mickey when I bought that, because that was one of my worst purchases to this day. The case wasn\'t grounded, so the headphones kept shorting out, and something was wrong electronically, so it unexpectedly turned itself off. Rubbish.Almost six agonizing months later, I managed to scrape together enough shekels to Get An iPod (please note the Capital Letters). Before I got mine, I shook my head, wondering who in their right mind would need 20 GB, even 4 GB of music. Now, I sing Apple\'s praises.I must say, the iPod is the epitome of tr&egrave;s cool. It is the most stylish and beautifully simplistic players out there. All lesser mortals bow down to this machine, and now I understand why. The elegant, color-coordinated click wheel is simple, and relatively easy to use, finding you favorite tune. The anodized aluminum case is one of my favorite features, understated (mine is silver) yet very sexy and classy. I feel as if I could jump up and down on the iPod Mini without consequence. (You couldn\'t pay me to demonstrate, though)Functionally, it\'s almost, ALMOST perfect. The interface is still one of the best I\'ve experienced, allowing you to find you music quite easily. However, the click wheel can be a little petulant for me at times, sometimes overshooting what I want, and sometimes being sluggish, even when I whip my digits around the white track fast enough to conjure up thoughts of carpal thumb and gangrene.Let\'s get to the best part; sound quality. The sound quality is the best I\'ve heard out of any MP3 player. The only complaint I have is the second day I used the iPod, I heard a faint crackling in both sides of the Sennheiser earbuds while listening to a song. A few days later, using different earphones on my laptop, running iTunes, I heard the same thing. Is this a problem with the proprietary Apple software and iPod firmware? Anyway, this problem went away, and I\'m still very, very pleased with the sound. It is phenomenal. My last niggle (I always seem to find something to complain about...)would have to be the loose fitting of the Sennheiser earbuds. It allows a lot of ambient noise to come in. I do own Sony Fontopia Earbuds with Anti-Bacterial Earpieces or the Bass Boost earbuds, but you can\'t beat the mystique and flash factor of those characteristic white earbuds. It\'s like a sign that says in huge letters, ""Yes, I\'m cool and I have an iPod"" I\'ll wait and eventually replace those Sennheisers with Sony Fontopia White earbuds...iTunes is fairly simple and straightforward to use, though with my notebook computer, I find that I must plug in the iPod before booting up, or iTunes will not recognize the iPod mini, instead displaying it as ""Offline"". This is maddening, but I can imagine desktop users don\'t have to deal with this.Though not perfect, it is, I think, one of the best MP3 players on the market today. I unhesitatingly reccommend audiophiles everywhere to plunk the $189-199 for this machine. It is absolutely worth it!',)"
"(""iPod mini was the hottest gadget last year & the best mp3 player around. Looks like this will be true even in 2005. There is absolutely no competition for the iPod's, no other player is even half as good as iPod.Pro's,1. Very good audio quality. Support for normal mp3's (unlike Sony).2. Small size (smaller than most cell phones like much-talked-about-Motorola-Razr)3. Extremely well desgined (let's hope Apple makes a cell phone and PDA in near future)4. Very intuitive interface (award winning touch wheel and minimal buttons)5. 4GB hard drive (enough space for about 800 mp3 songs)6. Available in many colors (hopefully Apple will come up with Nokia style faceplates for future Mini's)7. iTunes is one of the best music software around (rate songs, keep playcount, easy-sync with the iPod)8. Excellent screen for such small size9. Recharges from a standard USB port with the same cable as used for the upload of songs. No need to carry around a charger now.10. Tons of innovative accessories in the market (from Bose speakers to colorful socks!)11. Good battery life, about 10-14 hrs depneding on how much you surf around on it. ofcourse we all want more and there is no end to that demand :)12. Everything about the iPod Mini is designed to perfection (no other company has put this much time & effort into their mp3 players even in 4 yrs since iPod hit the streets)Con's,1. The battery is internal with no easy replacement chances2. Colors on the new Mini, except Silver, IMHO, are all gaudy. Last generation of Mini's had much pleasing colors. Check out for yourself at a local store before buying.3. Gold version has been dropped now, its become a collector's item? Instead of adding more colors they have dropped one!4. Doesn't come with a wall charger any more and takes longer to charge from USB port. You always need to be around a computer or pay extra for the charger.Its simply fabulous and I am running out of superlatives to describe it. Thanks Apple for the new iPod Mini!"",)"

"('PC manufacters just don\'t get it. Seems like the only kind of machine you can buy these days is a huge tower case with lots of fans, lots of noise to achieve that extra 10% performance.Reality is that for most uses, people just don\'t need to biggest baddest PC. It would be much more useful to have a small quiet yet capable machine.Apple has hit on a revolutionary idea. I expect you\'ll see lots of clones in the Wintel world soon.The Mini is simply amazing. Its like a folded up laptop without a display. Its incredibly small. So quiet that I have to put my ear on it to hear it. The DVD/CD drive is not quiet, especially when loading/unloading. If you tax the CPU, there is a fan inside that will spin up and can be noticable although still quieter than any PC I\'ve seen in recent history. The Mini also has excellent power management. It effortlessly goes into standby and starts back up quickly as needed. You never really need to turn it off.I\'m a Windows user. This is my first look at Mac. Mac OSX is a refreshing, wonderful alternative to Windows. So many times I\'ve complained about Windows and wished there was an alternative. Mac OSX is it. It is very powerful, flexible, secure and excellent performer. Its memory management is vastly superior to Windows.Coming from Microsoft\'s totally insecure, open to any attacker world of Windows, MacOSX is wonderful. You can create multiple users, limit what a user can do, protect your files from other users and applications. You can install applications within your own userid so that they can\'t damage your overall system. MacOSX is missing a firewall to control outbound communication. Several inexpensive good ones are available.Software included with the Mini is reasonably good. Enough to satisfy most basic users. iLife suite is nice, although I needed more function than is available from iDVD and iMovie packages.I bought the base Mini. I\'d recommend 512 meg instead of 256. The system runs in 256, but quickly has to start swapping and slow things down. MacOSX seems much more comfortable with 512 meg.I also bought the regular keyboard and mouse. Its a single button mouse, yet many operations require the second mouse button. This is done by pressing a key on the keyboard and click the mouse. Very inconvenient. I\'d recommend getting a 2 button mouse.Some folks have complained about display problems. I hooked mine up to a 20"" IBM monitor with no problems. Display is excellent, clear, bright, sharp, etc.This is a great system for both computer literate and computer phobic users. Although easy to use, there is lots of flexibility and power that is good to learn about and can get complicated.Not only is it hard to find a Wintel PC that\'s quiet, small with good power management, its practically impossible at any price. MacOSX proves that the insecurity that is taken for granted in the Windows world doesn\'t have to be that way. I\'m sure viruses and spyware will find their way onto Macs, but the MacOSX architecture greatly limits the ease with which attacks can occur.This experience has made me notice the Apple product lineup. In practice, an eMac maybe a better deal price wise because it includes a 17"" monitor. The iMac is realistically smaller than the Mini because the PC is built into the flatscreen monitor. But as a way to try the Mac waters, the Mini still seems like a good way to do it.Overall, I\'d strongly recommend folks give it a try.',)"
"('The basics have already been covered, so I am going to share a few tips on living with an iMac G5 20"".1. It is wide, but it is also on the tallish side. Some computer desks may not be compatible with the height. I put shelving in my office before the iMac G5 was announced, and wouldn\'t you know it - the shelves were installed ONE inch too low. So, double-check your clearances before you bring this monster home.2. The SuperDrive has ate everything I have ever thrown at it - DVD+r, -r, you name it. So, there are only two considerations on how to feed the beast - money, and time. The iMac doesn\'t seem to mind cheap or expensive disks, but sometimes cheap quality disks take longer to burn. So if you want to go a little cheaper on disks, be prepared to give up some time.3. Burnin\' rubber. Yep, this is a G5. Would you buy a Corvette to have it sit there and idle? Nosireebob. So the first thing you are going to do when you plug in and boot this bad boy is open the System Preferences, and click on Energy Saver. Click on the options tab and down on the left you are going to click on the pull-down menu next to where it says ""processor performance"". Set this menu to ""Highest"" and never look back. I haven\'t noticed the fan noise is atrocious, and I seem to be free of all problems I hear about other iMac G5 owners who keep their computers on ""Automatic"".4. Take every opportunity to make your PC-usin\' friends drool. They pretend not to like your Mac, but trust me - on the inside they are eatin\' their ever-lovin\' hearts out. Do they have anything in their universe even remotely this cool? Nope, and they never will. Plus, they still have to wait nearly 18 months for ""Vista""!5. Three words - killer surround sound. You now have what may be the most killer computer in the known universe, don\'t botch it now with cheap speakers or (GASP!) running with the internal speakers. Get thee and thine hence and purchase thee mighty, thundering speakers with wattage that bespeaks the power of God! Trust me, you don\'t want to watch movies on this big, beautiful, extra gi-nourmous widescreen and listen to the built-in speakers. It ruins the effect, and how. Speakers are like cars - there is no such thing as too much power.So let\'s recap - measure twice, feed the beast decent disks, warp speed Scotty, rub it in, and crank it a notch or thirty past 11. Do these things, and the iMac G5 will leave a smile on your face a mortican can\'t erase.',)"

"('This is a very nicely-packaged, fully-appointed device (big remote, 3 cables, AC adapter, batteries) that ""simulates"" surround sound to an impressive degree.  For those with HDMI and digital audio, its usefulness will obviously be restricted. But for those who use RCA jacks or headphones with a stereo mini-plug, it\'s guaranteed to work well with most any appliance or configuration that has two stereo speakers.  The device itself is very compact and light (less than half the size of the the colorful box that contains it).  The remote is almost as big as the processor, which in itself makes it one of the more practical remotes on the market (the ultra-compact Apple TV remote may look nifty, but what good is it if you can\'t find it?)Besides working with headphones when connected with a stereo receiver\'s or computer\'s audio output, it works as claimed with the 2.1 or stereo speaker system of many TV sets--and as a previous reviewer points out, the handy remote permits the user not merely to choose among ""Bypass,"" ""Stereo,"" and ""Surround"" settings but to click on ""Clarity"" for greater definition of spoken dialog.  Finally, the processor can be tailored to the size of the user\'s speakers: Small (headphones), Medium (bookshelf speakers), or Large (floor-standing size).  The settings are not merely ""show"": each makes a discernible, measurable difference in what is heard by the listener.  (Caveat: if you have a stereo TV post-2005, especially one that uses HDMI connections, make sure that it doesn\'t already have the EQ and voice clarity settings of the SOUNDaround which, inexpensive as it is, could end up collecting dust in the attic.  Fortunately, my Tennessee-manufacturered Sylvania tube TV is still going strong, its audio getting new life thanks to the device. And even if this gadget does nothing for your TV\'s audio, it\'s still guaranteed to make listening to music through headphones a new and bracing experience.)At its price when first released six years ago, it would deserve 4 stars.  At the current Prime price offered by GeeksWholesaler, it gets a high five.',)"
"('I bought this unit for my wife who does home health and is in the car all day long.  From what I see with all the competition, this unit has the biggest bang for the buck.  It is very easy to read, very bright screen even in daylight,  very reliable and seems to be very accurate on its directions.It comes with a decent mounting system by Ram Mounts.

Definately reccommend this as the unit to buy.Update:  While I still like this unit, I can say it does have one big flaw.  It is very sensitive to heat.  Most people will sit these on their dash, and on a car with a black interior and dash, in the summer that can get very hot.  When this unit gets hot, it shuts down.  AS it is, we are on our second unit, the first developed heat related problems and I sent it back under warranty.  Lowrance was very good about it, they sent a return shipping lable and shipped out a replacement unit free of charge.Having used it for quite awhile now, I am still impressed by the size, brightness and clarity of the screen.  Overall its direction finding ability is really good, but occasionally it makes mistakes and you have to be smarter than the machine.  On one occasion, we had to go to a house address in another town a half hour away.  Instead of taking us on the interstate which would have been a 20 min trip, it routed us through every side street it could think of since that was the shortest physical distance.  You can set parameters for that, but they don\'t hold if you shut it off.  On other rare occasions, it has gotten ""Confused"" and was telling me to take the wrong off ramp when I could see the signs in front of me for the right one.  That was probably due to an error in the navtec database (which all these machines run by the way).  I will probably try and buy the extended warranty with this unit before it goes out of warranty, I think we will need it.  Still, my wife has become dependent on this thing so that must say something for it.UPDATE #2:  I have had to send the back for the second time.  The first time it was replaced under warranty, this time its costing me 100 bucks.  I had the unit mounted in my truck since Momma got a new car with built in Nav and I got the GPS to use.  I had it mounted low in the vehicle and used a remote antenna which worked great, actually better performance than the built in antenna.  We pulled it out of the truck to use in a rental and it went haywire.  Definitely hardware problems.  Sent it back to Lowrance, they are building some replacement units so it has been gone about a month now.  They said the Touch screen and hard drive were bad on my unit.  While I really like the unit when it works, the heat sensitivity and the less than stellar reliability record would cause me to downgrade the rating to about a 3 if I could.',)"

"('I\'ve been running on Apple laptops for the past couple years, so it seemed natural to grab one of these as an upgrade.Let me start by saying it is a quality piece of hardware. My 15"" unit has the same screen resolution as my old 17"" G4, and is a great *potential* upgrade for 17"" users tired of carrying an aircraft carrier sized laptop.To better understand my 3 star rating, let me preface by saying that I\'m an amateur photographer. So a couple key elements for me are being able to import and process my photographs.The first gotcha -- no PCMCIA slot. Maybe the little slot they\'ve put into my 15"" model is a technical step up, but that doesn\'t help me be more productive with all me existing gear. Sure I can import directly from the camera, but I don\'t always want to have to drag it out and drain its battery. I often have several compact flash cards with pictures in them and shuttling them back into the camera is cumbersome. To me this was a real mess up on Apple\'s part. Many of us have large investments in PCMCIA hardware (microdrives, compact flash etc) and to arbitrarily muck that up seems like old school Apple arrogance.Second gotcha, no Intel native version of Adobe Photoshop and while the PPC version runs, it suffers *terribly* in performance. Add to that that I\'ve seen issues with minor file corruption when saving files from Nikon raw to JPG and its very clear that until the native version of Photoshop comes out, Intel Apples are crippled for anyone wanting professional level image editing.My 15"" MBP doesn\'t get uncomfortably hot while running, but the upper left hand corner warms up considerably while running all the old (PowerPC) applications.Will I get rid of my 15"" MBP? No. Would I recommend it to others, yes but with caveats. Think about what it is you need this machine to do for you. If you need a high performance application that hasn\'t been ported to the Intel version of the operating system, then stay away. If you\'re a typical office user who gets email, surfs and might use the built in video and picture programs then it will be ok for you.',)"

"(""I've always sworn by Linksys and Netgear, but this past summer, I was pulling my hair out with VOIP problems. On both my older Linksys Wireless-G router and a newer Netgear WGR614 router, all calls over VOIP would end spontaneously after 5-10 minutes. It varied and improved somewhat when I moved to the WGR614.On a whim, I purchased this from CompUSA. I'd had problems with D-Link in the past - two wireless routers in a row died in less than a year, just prior to purchasing my Linksys G-router. Oh man, how things have changed.1) VOIP is given priority on this router. I haven't dropped a Vonage call in three weeks.2) Where before my XBox live signal (XBOX360 w/ wireless-G adapter) was weak and prone to disconnection, this router provides a very robust and stable connection.3) Both of my Apple Powerbooks connect without issue. I've had problems with both the Linksys and Netgear router and WPA-PSK implementation. It would often kick back my password, deny access to the network, or my Apple would wake from sleep and not be able to find the network. Again, in three weeks, both Powerbooks have connected within seconds using WPA-PSK.4) It sounds stupid but...this router is attractive. No longer do I feel the need to hid the unit under a desk. It just looks...cool. LEDs are bright, though, so if you game in a darkened room with this router, watch out. ;)5) More intuitive interface than the competition.I've heard that D-Link provides weak support for their products, but then, so did Netgear and Linksys, both of whom I called about the VOIP issue and both, naturally, blamed it on the VOIP box. Hopefully, with such an outstanding product, I'm sure I'll never have to avail myself upon D-Link's tech support.Sure, this router is MUCH more expensive than the competition, but it works as advertised, provides a better WiFi signal and, most importantly, its CONSISTANT."",)"
"('My old Logitech Z-560 developed a short in it creating nasty crackling noises over one channel. The Z560 was a rare beast, a $140 400 watt 4.1 monster that Logitech built to really high standards to create a strong foot forward into the PC speaker market. Sadly, their quality has declined since then, and their current offerings are cheaply made, sound far worse with music than the 560s, and have even fuzzier and more overwhelming bass than the 560 did (the systems one flaw). I decided to try 2.0 systems to see if I could get good PC sound without the added failure risk of a high powered sub and the muddiness that all that extra bass and clumsy frequency transitions between sats and sub causes...My findings, from worst to best:Logitech Z-10: 30 watts. Looks good, costs a lot, $150, list. Sounds dreadful. Despite having a largish 3"" woofer, and a 1"" tweeter, the Z-10 seems to be doing a lot of signal processing of music and the soundstage sounds compressed and artificial. Changing bass and treble makes things worse, and your music will sound different (and worse) on these speakers than it would normally. The touch controls and LCD screen are useless pricy gimmicks that increase chance of failure and add weight and cost to the system. Who in the world needs to see the name of the track playing on the bottom of the speaker? Anyway, these are a disappointment, with the worst sound and tied for the highest price. The speakers are heavy and well made, very stylish, though easily smudged with the reflective black surface on the front of the speaker. Logitech needs to redo these, silly gadgets and useless feature are tolerable, bad sound however is always a deal-breaker. Two stars, for style and build quality.Klipsch ProMedia 2.0: Also 30 watts. Nice sound, good price, $100 list. Dual 2.5"" woofers and a 1"" tweeter with a Klipsch high-freq horn in it. These sound pretty good, but they are unexpectedly bulky and poorly made. The oddly formed speaker housing means these take up a lot of space and the volume and bass control knobs look like they come from a $10 CyberAcoutsics set. The cheapie knobs, bulk, and ugliness make these fit for corporate presentations where good loud sound matters and where style is largely irrelevant. For the home user, the cheap knobs may well break over time, which was the Achiles heel for my 560s; quality system, cheap volume pot. Three stars, good though not excellent sound, reasonable price, loses points for ugliness and some shoddy cost cutting in build quality. The bulk is sort of a neutral issue, as the larger box size probably helps the sound and bass extension of the units, but for some users the footprint and added portability difficulties may be an issue.Creative Gigaworks T20: 28 watts (though the box says 22 watts!) $100 list. Creative obscures most specs on these, probably fearing the single 2.5"" driver versus the bigger Logitech and the double same size drivers of the Klipsch may convince buyers that the T20 lacks in comparison to its rivals. Truth is the build and design of the T20s makes them sound much better than either the Z10s or the Promedias. These little speakers can put out an awesome amount of clear accurate sound, and they look great and feel very sturdy. Treble in particular is excellent, and the alleged Bass Xport technology must have something to it, as bass is more than adequate. The separate bass and treble knobs may or may not appeal; to some, they offer more control, to others the added circuitry distorts the signal and gives an added area of complexity in the design that may fail. The portability is excellent. The only real problem is that Creative is so secretive about the wattage and driver size, out of unnecessary concern that buyers may avoid getting these because of a few watts or a half inch. These sound great, look good, and the size to sound ratio is impressive. Four stars.M-Audio AV40s: 40 watts, $200 list. My personal choice, these speakers are much bigger than the other contenders, but the amazing sound and plentiful bass will convince you that you don\'t need to even think about a sub system. These wooden cabinets are very attractive and sturdy, but are not exactly portable weighing 14 lbs and being quite bulky. (More so than the Klipsch, but they also look nicer and are built better.) Besides the size and weight, the other issue is cost and maybe availability as few vendors sell M-Audio, and the price for the AV40s even with discount will be $50-$65 more than the cost of the other units I looked at. To me the sound and accuracy (no distortion at high volume, lots of accuracy at low volume) of the M-Audios, at both low and high volume, offsets all the problems. Four stars, loses a star because of higher cost and weight. (Note though these are still theoretically portable, far more so than any 2.1 system or even the average boombox...)Do You Need More Power, a Subwoofer, or More Speakers? Probably not. If you sit at your desk with the speakers a few feet away from you, you do not need much more than 30 or 40 watts for great powerful sound. A subwoofer (unless it costs a lot!) will just screw up crossover freqs, create too much bass, and encourage the mfgr to give you cheapie satellites on the theory that the loud prominent sub will wow the casual listener who will not care that the sats have 1"" uni-drivers and are made of cheap light plastic. Unless you need to entertain parties with your PC, you don\'t need more power or a sub.As far as surround sound, unless you watch movies on your PC or play a lot of FPS shooters that need positional audio, the added wires and difficulty of positioning the rear and surround sats in the listening environment are too much of a pain for most folks. Plus a decent PC surround sound system is at least $250, meaning a much higher cost than any of these 2.0 systems.Buying Recommendations: Don\'t mind big and bulky? Get the M-Audio AV40s. (Note the company has a smaller less powerful variant, the Av20s, but I did not hear these and they do not seem to be widely available so I cannot comment.) Want small and portable, get the Creative T20. The Logitechs unfortunately have no comparative strengths, and the Klipschs are adequate but offer no real advantage over the Creative. If you can find the Promedias significantly discounted, they may be viable.',)"
"(""Originally purchased this mouse for laptop use, but it immediately became my favorite mouse ever -- even for desktop use. Now I have Stowaways for all computers used on a routine basis.Don't let the small size fool you into thinking of the Stowaway as a poor portable substitute for a real mouse. The many positive synergies designed into this small, lightweight cordless optical mouse make it a joy for general use:[] Optical sensor lets you mouse on any surface with a bit of texture -- e.g., your thigh, or a good friend's thigh.[] Remote cordless operation makes many things possible -- e.g., control presentations out of your laptop from a podium 30 feet away.[] Small size encourages mousing with only your fingertips (instead of your whole hand  wrist, elbow or shoulder, as larger, heavier mice either invite or require). At that point, you're pointing only those muscles best suited to fine motor control and eye coordination.[] Finer control allows shorter throws to cross the entire screen. Once you've bumped up your pointer speed and acceleration settings to take full advantage, you'll find yourself able to...[] Mouse comfortably and accurately in =much= smaller areas -- e.g., on the handrest of a laptop keyboard deck, or even between those coalescing piles of junk on your desk. But even if you have all the room in the world...[] Shorter mouse excursions are better because they're ergonomcially safer for your wrist and less fatiguing in general.Among many other endearing qualities, the Stowaway also[] Works with the standard Bluetooth HID drivers built into WinXP and Win2000 (sorry, don't know about Macs) and pairs readily any standard Bluetooth device offering standard HID services -- nothing proprietary involved.[] Fits comfortably in a shirt or pant pocket.[] Has a very pleasing matte texture and positive controls.[] Runs on 2 AAAs: Rechargeable NiMH AAAs deliver plenty of range and days to weeks of runtime between charges. They're also lighter than alkalines and far more wallet- and environment-friendly. With a pair of even lighter disposable lithium AAAs along for reliable emergency backup (~15-year shelf life), you really have nothing to lose with rechargeables -- unless you happen to enjoy enriching battery companies. My 2 year-old manuals didn't list NiMH rechargeables as a power option, but  don't let that stop you.[] Provides an on-off switch, thank God: A Bluetooth mouse without an on-off switch can run through batteries of any type in under a day -- especially when its buttons can be activated inadvertently, or when its paired devices are off or out of range. (Learned that one the hard way.)[] Provides a reconnect button: All paired Bluetooth devices lose track of one another now and then. (Alien interference, terrorist jamming, sun spots-- who knows?) Anyway, this button forces the mouse to send a reconnect signal when needed.Enough. Try it -- you'll like it."",)"

"('This product gets 5 stars for the concept but I have to knock one off for the execution. If you\'re serious about using AA batteries for important purposes (like say flash units for serious photography, etc.) a genuinely smart charger like this one is a good idea.Most chargers are designed to only charge batteries in pairs. This is bad for several reasons. For one, you can\'t charge an odd number of batteries (like 1 or 3). But, worse, if the pair you\'re charging are discharged to different levels, the charger has a hard time figuring out when to shut off. It might shut off when the stronger battery is charged leaving the other one still weak. Or it might overcharge and damage the stronger battery waiting for the weaker one to reach full charge. Both are hard on your batteries.This is one of the few chargers that charges each battery independently on its own. So if you put 4 batteries in, one nearly dead, one at 30%, one at 60% and one at 90% it will give each exactly the amount of charge needed. That\'s a huge benefit.The other huge benefit is it can actually TEST and RATE your batteries for their actual capacity. This is important because you ideally want to use batteries with similar capacities together in the same device. Say you have a flashlight that needs 4 AA batteries. If one of the 4 is weak, the flashlight will die long before the others are depleted. Worse, that weak battery will be further weakened making things even worse for the next cycle.This charger lets you test your AA and AAA batteries as to their true capacity rating. It\'s also interesting to use this charger to see how close your batteries come to their ratings. I\'ve found the name brand cells (like Sanyo Enerloops) typically exceed their ratings when new. But the ""no name"" brands often fall far short of their optimistic ratings. This charger rates capacity in milliamp hours (maH) which is the industry standard.So why knock a star off? Turns out the software (firmware really) in this charger is kind of half baked. With some nearly fully charged batteries, you put them in and it says ""FULL"" and refuses to charge them even when they\'re not really full. And if a battery is completely dead it doesn\'t see it at all and hence can\'t charge it. And it also lets you set the charge current to questionably high levels--especially for AAA batteries. The default values are fine. I\'ve also had it ""glitch"" and sometimes mess up on one cell. I\'ll put 4 equally discharged closely matched batteries in it. And it will fully charge 3 of them and only half charge one of them. That hasn\'t happened very often, but it\'s happened more than once.The good news is the display gives you enough information to know what\'s going on. So if something does go wrong, you\'re aware of it. Most chargers just have green/red/blinking LEDs that can\'t tell you much.All-in-all this charger is a big ugprade over most and does a much better job than most. The batteries that are bundled with some versions also test out well.',)"
"(""Given this charger and another are so similar, its good to compare them both. Maha WizardOne Charger-AnalyzerThe Pros:About half the Maha's size, with similar featuresIndividual LCD readouts for each battery chamber, whereas Maha shows each sequentiallyCustom travel case, D and C converters included in the kit, Maha _may_ have a free vendor supplied caseUniversal automatic AC charger for 100-240Vac, as does the MahaIncludes 2600mAH AA x 4 and 1000mAH AAA x 4 standard NiMH cells [ using both the Lacrosse and Maha test suites, these batteries were reported as ~ 2200mAH AA and 900 mAH AAA]The Cons:The chambers are not independent.  Current set up for one chamber, is the upper limit for others and if chamber 1 is set past 1.5A, it disables chamber 2 & 3.  The charge current increments in steps: 2,5,7,10,15,18 [x100 mA] but can only discharge a maximum of 500mA.  The Maha increments linearly + 100mA, each chamber independent of any other, whether in charge or discharge mode. Having more freedom in charge currents can better match a cells updated AH, based on a test mode of used NiMH cells. Maha discharge current maximum is 1A, but its charge current can be set as desired.  The Lacrosse always charges 2x the discharge current.The discharge mode will charge after a cell is discharged; after I left it unattended for some hours, it forgot the discharge mAH rating. The Maha only discharges, then logs the value until you pull the battery from the chamber.  Pure discharge allows users to fully test the true capacity of a battery.The charger run warmer.  See uploaded pictures.  My test batteries caused several shut downs due to overheating, the same batteries run cooler and complete charging on the Maha.  While charging newSanyo EneloopAA at 1000mA the Lacrosse took the cells to 115-120F, the charger reached 140F, while the Maha did not take cells past 95F and the charger as a whole reached 120F. The recommended maxmium charging temperature is 113F  or 45C, and shut down is about 60C.You can reset the current cycle of any chamber in the LaCrosse by pressing its number button for over 1 sec.  While seemingly a feature, its too easy to reset some hour long cycles, like the test or refresh, accidentally.The Test mode reported AH is less accurate. After doing pure discharge of cells through the Maha or LaCrosse [taking care to check it before it resets], the actual mAH of either the LaCrosse or Maha is closer to the Maha reported 'breakin' value.The selector buttons for each cell are not durable.  Its a plastic plunger that tapers like an arrowhead fitting in a small dimple on a springy metal contact on the PCB.  After 4 days of testing, a plunger stuck pressed on.  After more days, the tip of 3 selectors eroded or broke at different levels, so now the buttons are at uneven heights, hopefully they don't break completely.  It is as easy repair if you are handy, but you have to open the unit and know what to do.The PCB is all SMT technology, with some rather fair quality hand soldering, causing areas with uncleaned excess flux. The interior of the Maha is thoroughly professional.KeystrokesWhile seemingly less keystrokes are needed to get custom settings in the LaCrosse, its more time consuming because there is a fixed delay between each press before a readout change occurs.  In the Maha, each keystroke results in an instantaneous response, so even if more are needed, the response is faster.  More annoyingly, setting the current on chamber #1 higher than allowed for all 4 chambers together will reset settings for chambers 2,3.Easy Mode: Default Charge CurrentIf one needn't bother with buttons, just placing the cells into the charger is all that's needed to begin charging.  The LaCrosse uses 200mA, whereas on the Maha is 1000mA.  The LaCrosse slow charges  2A NiMH in ~ 10 hours, whereas the Maha defaults at 2 hour charge, and cells do not exceed 40C.  Heat is one factor in improper charging and reducing long term battery life, and since the LaCrosse tends to run warmer at 1000mA, it makes sense to use slower charge currents. You can charge cells at C0.5 without ill effects, and most cells today are 2AH or higher, so 1000mA is fine, and 200mA is very conservative.Conclusion:This charger has similarities to the Maha but with improved ergonomics, to make it an ideal portable charger for taking on trips.  However, the Lacrosse has several flaws that would preclude using it as a preferred charger for all your AA/AAA cells, as better chargers exist: its test mode, its discharge mode, and a fatal flaw, it charges hotter than the Maha at similar currents.  The Maha is technically superior but its main drawback is size & ergonomics, but it provides a better charge, test, discharge, and recondition modes.  If a user bothers doing battery tests, cycles and refreshes, why settle for less capable, unless size is an issue.  I see the Lacrosse as a general purpose swiss army knife like tool for trips, but when I need a real tool at home, I'll reach for the Maha.I've added photos of oscilloscope waveforms of the charge voltage of both models, showing they are not identical.  Whether either model truly makes a difference in the longevity of NiMH cells, only time will tell.  I do use well cared for AA cells still working past 7 years old.  Discharge testing shows both models effective in charging cells.  However, its known heat during charging is a key factor in reducing long term battery life, and this is clearly what the LaCrosse tends to do over the Maha.  To minimize its effect, I would run the LaCrosse at its side, prop the bottom up or rig up a small computer fan to force ventilate the unit; Maha was aware of heating and built their charger with a stand so the tilted angle ventilates the charging chips.Lastly, China has made many wonderful products, but they continue to learn the trades.  The Maha is an all Taiwan product, a country with a long mature history of making excellent electronics."",)"
"('The BC-9000 buttery charger by La Crosse Technology.I have been a rechargeable battery user for quite some time now.  I\'d say close to 15 years.  Every few years I get tired of buying disposable batteries, thinking that it is a pure waste of money.  Then I tell myself, ""you know Mike, you could save a lot of money, not to mention also keeping the landfill a little bit less full, if you would just use rechargeable batteries."" So, after talking myself in to it, I\'ll purchase the newest and best rechargeable batteries.  The ones with the highest amp HRS available at the time.  And A charger that a find locally.This has always ended up with the same outcome in the past.  The batteries at first are great.  The life of them is very comparable and sometimes better than their disposable counterpart.  So I\'m happy.  But then, after some time, when a new battery is needed, It find them dead, without any charge left.  So naturally, I have always thought that is just the way rechargeable batteries are.  So then I give my rechargeable battery collective to somebody I feel at the time could use such a thing.So here I am a $100 less wealthy and nothing to show for it.  Of course I still have a good feeling that I tried something good.  I at least know the flaws in this technology and I can tell other people what to expect, as to save them time and money.  So at least I can feel that I have bought and something for my money.But, with my persistence, I have finally uncovered the error of my ways.  I was pretty sure if I kept at this long enough I could make it work.  It turns out that the batteries are not of poor quality, but rather the charger.  The run of the mill chargers do not FULLY charge the battery, so after a short time the battery will show up dead.  The trouble is that it was never REALLY charged to begin with.In a charger available at almost any store, there is more than one battery per circuit; usually two or four.  The problem begins when using such a device, one battery might fill up first and then the other continues to charge until it reaches full.  All the time, ""burning"" the first battery.  Now this may be irrelevant for a month or two, but that\'s when your little collection becomes worthless to you.  Each time a battery is ""burned"" by overcharging, it loses a little bit of its capacity.  After 10-20 cycles, this can really be noticed easily.But this little charger has a separate circuit for each battery, and you can put batteries of different domination (AA or AAA) into each circuit.  And when the charging cycle is completed, the charger will switch over to a ""trickle charge"" mode.  This will keep the battery full charge without ""burning"" it.  It also has a refresh mode that says it will revive your old batteries which have developed a ""memory"" effect by not being fully charged.  This is different from the memory effect caused by not fully draining batteries, of which NiMH are said not to obtain.  I cannot review or this feature as the only batteries I have left in my collective are new.Since I have not had this device for long, I will make an amendment to this article as time goes on.So in short, rechargeable batteries do not suck, just the charger in the stores do.  With a charger such as this, you WILL take on a different outlook on batteries.  In combination with the advent of new ""low discharge"" batteries, you can keep the batteries charged for an entire year with only a 15% loss.  I want as many people as possible to learn from my very costly mistake.',)"

"('I have mixed feelings about this product.  Even though I still rated it with 5 stars simply because you got much more than what you pay for it at $200 from Amazon.Let\'s start with the features which I have issues with1. Resume-to-play function: Most of DVD player allows you to resume scene from last time you stop.  For this product, it does also only when power still on.  If you power down the product, then it will resume from the begining of the disc next time you power-on the product.  One way to get around it will be to eject the disc before power down and allow the disc to load while power down.  Then, you can press the ""select"" buttom to resume the last scene next time when you turn on the product.  It works but very annoying.2. Quality control: The DVI-HDMI cable comes with the product seems varies a lot in quality.  My 1st units arrived with good cable and everything works fine.  My 2nd unit arrived with questionable cable and I saw lots of flicker noises when played at 720P mode.  I returned the unit and re-order another one, same problem.  Gladly, the OPPO company locates close to my area and I am able to bring the product to their site.  They tested the unit with no issue at all and I stood there embrassed since I was so sure it was the unit has problem.  They swapped me with new cable.  For the very same unit, it works flawlessly with the right cable.3. Compatibility: If you have Toshiba rear projection large size TV, this product is not for you but rather the OPDV970 does.  Accordingly to OPPO technical personnel, Nathon and Jin , OPDV971 has clocking incompatibility issue with Toshiba TV.  You will see 3 finger wide of light green bars on 1/20th and 2/3 of the screen.  I swapped my 971 with 970 and it works well with my Toshiba rear projection TV.Now, let me share what I really like about this product1. It can read all format, all regions disc with superior video quality.  My Toshiba DVD player, costs me more than 1KUSD 5 years ago , can\'t even compare video quality at 480P through component output.2. Video coming out from DVI, Component, Sviode, composite all are available.  Easy for anyone to compare video quality from 720P through DVI with the component output at 480P.3. Compact and sleek4. Service: OPPO is very hard to find.  I went there twice and each time took me more than 20 minutes to locate them.  Their technical personnel is very knowledgeable and helpful.  As soon as you open up your issue statement, they seems to know the cause and promptly address your issue.  Here is the number to reach them, 650-9611118.5. Video quality: DVI output at 720P has this cool-feeling video quality while component output provide warm video quality.  So, you can change from cool to warm video images on the fly based on audiance acceptance.6. Cheap.  I was very skeptical about what a $200 upconversion DVD player can do when I had my 42 inches LCD HD TV ordered.  Now, I am deeply satisfied with this product.  Most importantly, I have my perceptions changed about product-made-in-China since this product indeed comes from China and it is GOOD.',)"

That aside, my first impression was overall positive: the bag was attractive and made of ballistic nylon, with yellow-colored foam padding inside. That\'s worth one star. The mesh pocket on the outside with a drawstring cord-lock looked a little cheap, however. It might be good for a lens cap, but not much else.One problem is that the bag appears bigger on the outside than it is on the inside, unlike my Kata and Lowepro bags, which use available space well. There\'s a slight inward curve to the bag which does offer protection, but also makes the corners and sides bends inwards a bit, which can exacerbate space issues. more on this later...Opening the bag by the center-mounted click-lock, the rain flap flips up to reveal a yellow pocket with a business card holder. Ok, so far, so good. Then you have to raise the top of the bag to reach the main compartment. Inside the main compartment, there are two cutouts for camera bodies at either side and a middle \'lens section\' with six slots. Each of these slots is maybe big enough for a small prime lens, but they are reconfigurable. It looks fine, until you start to put some gear in it.So i had a gripped D90w/ a wide-angle tokina 12-24 lens w/reversed hood which i put in one side. You have to remove one of the velcro padded strips to fit a gripped body. In the other cutout, i attempted to put my d300s w/ tamron 28-75, no hood--which is a pretty small lens. No dice. there\'s not enough clearance to fit two bodies with lenses attached through the cutouts, unless you have small primes on both of them. Minus one star. I attempted a workaround: Removing the padding again, i placed the d300s vertically. it fit, but just barely. It would have been awkward had i had the grip on.The bag does hold two bodies, but not both in the cutouts, lens-mounted. But with even one body in the cutout, the lens compartments are fairly inaccessible. I did manage to get the following gear inside the bag: d90w/12-24 (Horizontal in cutout); d300s w/28-75(vertical); 50-150. It was a tight fit. But when i switched the 50-150 to the d300s, there was even less room.Here\'s where another major design flaw comes into play: there\'s no separation between the lens attached to the camera and the lenses or other items in the dividers. So in practice, your lenses will be knocking and rubbing together the entire time they\'re in the bag, unless you lay it down on a flat surface.Even worse, there was no room to fit the flash inside the bag. I tried it in various locations--the external mesh, the internal top flap pocket, the external top flap pocket--but it seemed like an inelegant compromise. My sb-600 flash is a mid-sized nikon, so it\'s not the biggest flash they make. Without the diffuser, it fit into the other side pocket, but i had to remove the eneloop AA batteries which i had tucked into the elastic loops. And, that compartment isn\'t padded, either. So, again,a  less than ideal situation--you can\'t have your flash with diffuser ready to shoot in that pocket. you\'d have to take the flash out, and then put the diffuser on, possibly missing a shot in the process. and, you can\'t store a flash and extra batteries in the same pocket. The flash will fit in the front pocket, which has a double-zip, a padded pocket with a mesh front on one side, and three nylon sleeves on the other. If you put it in the filter pocket, it\'s at least partially padded, which is somewhat reassuring considering its the first line of impact against bumps, but then it would require a two-handed zipper pull and another zipper pull before it can be extracted.The niggles dont stop there, unfortunately. The shoulder strap is cheap and the pad can\'t be adjusted. You can adjust the length, but it\'s just not a quality strap.The biggest niggle, though, is that the side-position cutouts make it awkward to remove the camera. Because the sides and top of the bag curve inwards, positioning your camera this way makes it swallow the edges of your body. It\'s better to pull out a body by the body--not the lens, which could strain the mount--but it\'s difficult to do this one-handed. Just not a smooth draw. It\'s like you\'re fighting with the bag. If you have to put the bag down to get the camera out, it kind of defeats the purpose.This could cause consternation in the field, or worse, damage your equipment. You can avoid the cutouts--that would be my recommendation--and place the camera(s) face down with the lens pointing at your feet. There\'s enough room for a gripped camera with w/a or telephoto lens, but two bodies mounted this way leaves little room in the bag for anything else.You also have to be careful with a d90, for instance--a couple of times, i opened the memory card door just trying to get the camera out. The d300s has a more solid grip and a slightly different door design so less of a problem there.I was about to give up on the Ape Case when i discovered a workaround: if you avoid the cutouts altogether, the ergonomics get much better. Reconfiguring the yellow dividers to the center--it took me a while to figure this out--it is possible to store the camera in ready position. you can use the divider thingys to make an oval-shaped lens cradle and slot the camera in it. on the other side, there\'s room for the flash w/diffuser (yay!) and a compact zoom or a prime. at either side, you now have storage space in two ""hidden compartments"" plus additional berths on top. best configuration for the \'storage bins\' would be stuff you don\'t need to access frequently: cables, chargers, rocket blowers, extra battery, etc. you can also fit either a medium telezoom or 1-2 small lenses.with this set up, i was able to fit:*d90w/grip+ tokina 12-24w/hood reversed or d300s w/50-150/2.8 hood reversed*sb-600 flash; tamron 28-75/2.8*nikon 70-300 ED*sigma 30/1.4; sigma 15/2.8 fisheye...all in the bag.i still had room in the two \'top\' containers, the side battery compartment, and the front zip compartment.the setup was heavy but not unbearable, thanks to the Ape Case\'s well-padded back panel. it would have been nice had there been a slot to thread a hipbelt to help stabilize the load.bottom line: the Ape Case 1400 is more of a medium-small than a large. i wouldn\'t recommend overstuffing this bag. it works best as a one-body set up with nothing too exotic, though you can store a second body with body cap on. if you want to be able to access the camera quickly, set it up in the middle of the bag. otherwise, you could encounter issues.On the plus side, the case seems fairly rugged, and well-padded. And the price is inexpensive.But the Ape Case 1400 is clearly a notch below more expensive offerings from Kata, Lowepro, Tamrac, and Tenba in terms of build quality and  ergonomics. i ordered the Lowepro Stealth Reporter 550 AW for my \'pro\' 2-body setup, and maybe i\'ll set this up for casual, one-body shooting.',)"
"('I can\'t see how most pros would find this adequate, but I like it a lot. I\'ve got a Nikon, so I wish the ""lens gap"" could be adjusted better for the off center DSLRs, and I find there\'s really not all that much flexibility despite the sort of modular look and the velcro holding the compartment dividers, but they give and move.It works for me to carry the D5000 with the 55-200 lens attached, plus schlepping along a Canon FS-100, a Canon Elph, my Zoom H2 audio recorder and all the associated chargers, some spare batteries and sundry accouterments. Convenient to carry if you\'re not a photojournalist, in other words, but I don\'t think you\'d find it spacious enough if you routinely rely on more than one DSLR body and a full suite of lenses. I use pictures as an adjunct to journalism, not the centerpiece of my work.I read one review that complained about the ""superfluous"" clips, but I think they keep the strain off the zipper which will add to the longevity.  The complaints about the strap being the weakest link in the chain are perhaps valid, but it\'s working for me and a strap can be swapped/replaced without much effort.The yellow interior ROCKS. The plain black exterior that isn\'t covered with logos that scream ""steal me, I\'m pawnable"" is a plus to me. As soft-bags go this was far and away the best I saw for the money, but again for pros it\'s likely not enough (and many prefer a hard case to better protect their investment - after all, I\'m not carrying around a D700 or an EOS 50D and $2000-$6000 lenses.) Factor in PRIME shipping and it\'s a great value.UPDATE: mid 2013 and this is still a GREAT investment.  I typically stash 2 DSLRs with attached lenses and a variety of other gear including a blackRapid strap in this utterly reconfigurable bag.  I talked work into one since I take a lot of photos there, too, and carry a Cannon and several lenses including a 300mm -- my only real addendum is get the full-sized case.  They hold up well, and I can\'t imagine a better product unless you need something to carry still more accessories. (If Ape had another size up I\'d go to 5 stars!)',)"
"('The Fujifilm FinePix F10 is a 6.3MP point-and-shoot digital camera made by Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan (and in Japan).  Fujifilm is Fuji\'s brandname here in the U.S.  If I say ""Fuji"" in this review, you know I mean Fuji the company or Fujifilm the brand.While neither thin nor stylish, the F10 truly excels in picture quality.  Whether used indoors or outdoors, the F10 takes sharp pictures with very pleasant colors.  If you ever used Fuji\'s color film in the past, you know the company is famous for true-to-life color reproduction on film.  This F10 carries on this tradition and the pictures it takes are very pleasing to the eye.The most amazing part about the F10\'s excellent, superb picture quality is there\'s very little noise even at high ISOs, such as 400 or 800.  (I\'ll explain ISO in a bit.)  At 1600, the highest setting, you\'ll notice some noise when you view a picture at its full resolution.  However, when you print an ISO 1600 picture from the F10 at 5x7"" or smaller, the print quality will still be excellent.(ISO refers to the sensitivity of the camera\'s sensor.  In the old days of film photography, it referred to the film ""speed.""  It was also known as the ASA rating before it became an international standard.  The higher the ISO setting, the less light you need for a proper exposure, but also the more noise, or digital specks, you get in the final picture.  This phenomenon is a law of physics.)The bottomline is, F10 takes amazingly beautiful pictures.  I rate its picture quality higher than my 6.1MP digital SLR, the Nikon D70.  I also rate it higher than all my previous compact digital cameras from Canon, Casio, Minolta, Nikon, and Sony.  I cannot describe how much I\'m in awe with the F10\'s picture quality performance.In short: if you want a compact digital camera that takes truly excellent pictures, you should just get an F10.There are two reasons for the F10\'s top-of-the-class picture quality: 1) its CCD sensor (the camera\'s eye) is 1/1.7"" in size, which is bigger than most compact digital cameras\' sensors; 2) it uses new-generation Super CCD technology developed by Fuji -- there are actually a total of 6.63 million pixels on the CCD sensor, of which 6.3 million are displayed in the final image, which means the extra 330,000 pixels are used to provide additional information about exposure and color.  This extra information, even though not visible in the final picture, helps the camera\'s ADC (analog-to-digital circuit), which is the camera\'s brain, produce an awesome picture.Add to the big CCD sensor a superior 3x Fujinon lens (Fujinon is Fuji\'s brandname for its line of camera lenses) and Fuji\'s know-how in reproducting eye-pleasing colors, you get picture quality that will make everyone happy.The F10\'s excellent high-ISO performance also means you can take natural-looking portraits indoors without resorting to the harsh white light of the camera flash.  You know how it is: you take a picture of a group of friends indoors, and everyone in the front looks like Michael Jackson (the guy who bleached himself) and the rest in the back look like dark-gray wolves hiding in the forest.  The F10 has a ""Natural Light"" mode which suppresses the flash, jacks up the ISO, and takes a picture that looks soft and pleasant.  If you did this with most other digital cameras, you\'ll get lots of digital freckles on your friends\' faces.  With the F10, the result is much more pleasing and the freckles much less noticeable, especially in final print (unless you print a poster the size of Niagara Falls).The F10 can also take movies.  You choose from two resolutions: VGA (640x480), which is the default, or QVGA (320x240).  The movies are taken at 30fps so they are pretty fluid.  The VGA resolution means you can actually use this as a camcorder -- just make sure to get a large xD memory card.  (See my review of the Fujifilm 1GB Type M xD card for some details.)Now, if you are a control freak type, the F10 may not be right for you.  This camera is designed as a point-and-shoot, or as they call it, a foolproof photo machine.  You don\'t get many manual controls.  You can\'t control shutter speed or aperture.  You can\'t focus manually.  Even the image quality and resolution settings are simple: whereas other brands let you set quality (i.e., JPEG compression level) and resolution separately, on the F10 you have a total of six choices that encompass both quality/compression and resolution.I *am* a control freak, but I don\'t mind the F10\'s lack of manual controls because, 1) I have my Nikon D70 digital SLR whenever I need ultimate ""artistic"" controls, and 2) I bought the F10 as a point-and-shoot for the times when I\'m too lazy to want to make any manual adjustments.  You should ask yourself how important manually setting focus or adjusting aperture/shutter speed is for you when you consider the F10.What else is there to say?  Oh, the F10 is quite easy to hold.  It\'s not ultra-thin or ultra-compact, so it\'s actually easier for me to hold.  It has a large 2.5"" LCD screen which acts both as the viewfinder (to compose the picture) and playback screen.  It\'s sharp and bright (and can ""gain up"" to superbright in low light situations) and displays fluid motions.  The F10 lacks an optical viewfinder (which some photo purists will insist on having) but does have an AF-assist lamp to improve autofocus in dim light situations.In terms of ease of use, the F10 is very easy to pick up and go.  You almost don\'t need to read the manual to get started.  On the other hand, almost all controls are accessed via a menu system, which is not the best kind of control scheme in the world.  The user\'s guide is your typical Japanese-translated-into-poor-English type you\'d expect from a Japanese manufacturer.In summary, like the other reviewers have pointed out, this camera ranks very high in the picture quality department.  As long as you are comfortable *not* having manual controls other than ISO setting and exposure compensation, I bet you\'ll be very happy with the F10\'s picture quality.  Its exterior styling doesn\'t excite anyone, but as columnist David Pogue of the New York Times (and Macworld) points out: in photography, it\'s the inside that should count -- and he endorses the F10.BTW, the F10 is made in Japan, unlike other similar-priced digital cameras which are usually assembled in Indonesia, Thailand, China, or the Phillipines.',)"
"('I have had mine for about nine months. It\'s an interesting thing, a cheap compact digital camera with a very high resolution for its price bracket, a full range of manual photography controls, and a RAW mode that lets you apply all the image processing yourself. It has some quirks and overall I was both impressed and a little disappointed with it. It feels like a budget digital camera body/lens with the heart of a mid-range fixed-lens quasi-SLR. You\'ve probably read lots of reviews on the internet, and I won\'t reiterate them. In general the camera doesn\'t seem to have much of a following, it\'s rarely mentioned on websites, and I assume it has been discontinued. It is just barely mentioned on Fuji\'s website. I believe it was the last of Fuji\'s E-series cameras.On the positive sise, it has a non-interpolated nine megapixel resolution, which is still competitive nowadays. Nine megapixels is overkill for most applications, but it\'s very useful if you like to crop the images, because they remain high-resolution even after you\'ve chopped half of the picture away. You can go down to five, three, or two megapixels, and VGA. The nine megapixel resolution has normal and fine JPG options, the others do not. In RAW mode a 1gb XD card stores 54 images. 9mp fine gets you 228 pictures, the rest hover around 1,000 pictures, give or take a few hundred.The camera is small and light, and fits into a pocket easily. There is a full range of manual photography options. You can set the shutter speed, aperture, ISO level, there are various autofocus modes, and you can bracket the exposure, although you can only bracket by a maximum of one f-stop. You can shoot RAW. You can have a live histogram display on the LCD screen, although you have to hold down a button. Startup time is very quick, the zoom and autofocus are fairly quiet although not silent. You don\'t hear them in a crowd. The camera runs on 2xAA batteries, which are available in every shop in the world. The camera comes with a pair of batteries and a charger, which is handy. It uses tiny XD cards which can be had cheaply online. Windows XP sees the camera as a standard external storage device, rather like a USB memory stick, so you can just drag and drop the pictures onto your PC rather than having to use proprietary software. In fact you can use the camera as a USB stick, if you want, you can use it to carry MP3 files around, such as Paul McCartney\'s 1986 album Press to Play, which is fully as bad as the critics say, it\'s awful. I imagine he wrote ""However Absurd"" as a copy of ""I am the Walrus"", but he got it all wrong.You set the custom white balance by photographing e.g. a grey card, and using that as a template. You cannot however take several pictures and use them as white balance templates, as in some professional cameras, but at least you have a custom option. Alternatively you can shoot RAW and set the white balance later on.The image quality has been covered extensively on the internet. In low ISO modes using the camera\'s image processing, the image quality is very good in daylight, not bad indoors, but the camera has an odd shutter speed limitation that bothers me. I will write about this later. At 200 ISO and up the noise reduction gives everything an unpleasant plastic quality that resembles the work of George Seurat. The noise reduction algorithm tends to make the images look grainy in an unpleasant way. If you shoot flat surfaces such as walls and skies etc it\'s not so bad, but detailed objects suffer. If however you shoot with a lower ISO mode, but with a longer shutter speed, it\'s not so bad, indeed the low-light image quality is impressive if you use a tripod. Part of the reason I am so harsh on the camera\'s image quality is that the image flaws are very apparent when viewed at 1:1 on the screen, because the pictures are so large. If you crop the picture and then squash it down for the internet, say 1024x768, the grain isn\'t nearly as noticeable. If you shoot RAW you can bypass the noise reduction entirely. With RAW at ISO 80 there\'s a certain amount of grain, but it\'s not unpleasant grain, it has a film-like quality. The camera takes a few seconds to save each RAW file. I believe it interpolates them to 18mp and then de-interpolates them back down to 9mp again, which must take time.Battery life seems to be good. I have taken it with me around and about, and shot a couple of hundred pictures a time, at nine megapixels, with enough juice left over to look at them, download them, and fiddle with the camera afterwards, using 2500 Ni-MH batteries. It\'s not a problem to carry around a spare set of AAs, or buy them, or borrow them.The camera has some problems. The lens has a slightly wider field of view than other compact cameras, which is theoretically great, except that it distorts around the edges. If you take a shot of a painting, for example, the edges of the painting bulge out a little bit. You can fix this with software but it\'s a bind. The lens doesn\'t cope well with flare, so if you shoot a night scene with streetlights the lights will have stars coming out of them, and they will probably have a purple cast. There\'s a lot of purple fringing around the edges of things. I wish that Fuji had used a better lens. You can fix most of these problems with software, but as I say, it\'s boring to do so.The maximum shutter time is fifteen seconds, at least in manual mode. In practice, if you set the camera to P or AUTO the maximum shutter time is 1/4 second, which isn\'t long enough at f2.8 if you want to take shots indoors without a flash (perhaps you have a tripod, or a very steady hand, or a steady beer glass, and you don\'t want to blind people). You could use shutter priority mode, in which case the maximum shutter speed is three seconds, which is not such a problem but why the limitation? It\'s a shame there isn\'t a simple automatic setting that lets you just point and shoot without limiting the maximum shutter speed. That\'s one point in favour of my old Olympus XA, or Yashica Electro. With those cameras you press the button and PAF, the shutter stays open as long as it needs to stay open.There are some minor niggles. The flash isn\'t motorised, and so you have to manually open and close it. After you take a flash picture, the camera shows you the picture and then the screen goes blank for a second or so, presumably waiting for the flash to recharge. The body feels lightweight and hollow. It\'s very plastic, with some silvery plastic bits that look silly. There\'s a gap around the USB port which looks as though it will let dust into the camera\'s innards. The master program dial feels flimsier than the equivalent Canon Powershot dial, and doesn\'t click as positively. I often find myself pulling the Finepix out of a pocket, to find that it has flipped to one of the other shooting modes.If you set the camera to take a time delay exposure, subsequent exposures do not use time delay, and so you have to set time delay over and over again. This sounds picky, but it\'s a real problem if you\'re taking a lot of product photographs, perhaps using the macro mode. You want as little camera shake as possible, and the self-timer is ideal for this, but with the E900 you have to press MENU RIGHT UP MENU after every single shot. Not fun if you have to take several dozen pictures.A final niggle is that the option to shoot RAW is buried in one of the setup menus, rather than being right at the top level. You\'ve probably read this complaint in all the other reviews. My guess is that most people who buy this camera do so in order to shoot RAW, and so they notice how fiddly it is to select. If you want to shoot at five megapixels or change to 3:2 aspect ratio there is a dedicated image quality menu button. But for RAW you have to press MENU DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN SET DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN RIGHT UP SET, and the same again to turn it off.Oddly, and this isn\'t really a criticism, the wider 3:2 aspect ratio setting produces images that have a greater horizontal resolution than the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. It\'s as if the camera is expanding the pictures outwards rather than just cropping off the top of bottom. I\'m not complaining, I\'m just curious.In summary the E900 is, or was, very impressive for the price. It feels flimsy and you\'ll never have people cooing at it, asking you to let them have a go, but it does the job for snapshots especially if you shoot RAW. The two big problems for me are the lens, and the odd 1/4 second exposure limitation. Given that digital cameras have come down in price over the last year it might be better to get an equivalent Powershot, even if it has a lower resolution. I find that nine megapixels seems like overkill, and I end up cropping most of my pictures and then sizing them down anyway. In theory I could make big prints, but I wouldn\'t with this camera because of the purple fringing and unpleasant noise reduction.As a footnote, there\'s an extension mount and a pair of accessory lenses. The mount feels flimsy and wobbles. The telephoto lens is limited by the shutter speed limitation as above - and it\'s not very telephoto. The wideangle lens is silly but fun. It\'s totally impractical, large and heavy, and unbalances the camera, and the images are even more distorted than usual, but it attracts attention. It\'s not a fisheye though. You can theoretically attach filters and so forth to the extension mount, if you have a 43mm filter or adapter. Avoid Paul McCartney\'s Press to Play at all costs.',)"
"(""When I first received my S9000 I was completely in love with it. It had all the features I was looking for in one package for my travel needs. Only weeks after I had been using the camera the selector dial quit working making it unable to access certain menus and features reducing it to a fancy point and shoot camera. Then I enlarged some of my photos and realize about 1/5th of the left side of each photo was blurred. The rest of the photo was in focus.  I went into my archive and realized this was the case with each photo I had taken when I pulled them up to 100%. I then inspected my zoom photos and not one of them was in focus when the zoom was used at full extension even with tripod. This all happened while on vacation. When I returned home I mailed in camera to Fuji to be repaired. It was sent back with blur problem on left fixed but zoom was still fuzzy. I informed them I was leaving on another trip and I needed a quick remedy. The only thing they could do was tell me to ship it in once again. I reluctantly shipped in the camera and was sent a different one...which also had problems with fuzzy zoom. I called up in tears telling them the problem was not yet fixed and once again was told to send the camera back in. I was assured they would fix and return it to me in time for my trip. They did overnight fed-ex me a shipping label, so I had some hope that they were on the ball. But I checked the Fed-Ex shipping number just before we left for our trip and I know Fuji had received it a couple days earlier but it had not been logged in by customer service. We were gone for a 10 day trip and I made it back home before the camera was returned from Fuji. They sent me a totally new camera and I've been so disgusted with the whole experience that I won't use the camera. I'm very happy with the Nikon D80 we bought to use on the trip after the S9000 was not returned to us in time.I don't think I will ever buy another Fuji product because I now have serious doubts about their quality control and I'm fed up with their customer service.  If you do plan to buy this camera, buy it with plenty of time to work out the bugs before any important trips.I would give this camera only one star after my experience if not for the fact that it takes great micro macro shots. That was one feature I was  pleased with even when the left side was blurry.  It would be the only reason I would hang onto this camera that has me so frustrated.The good points, great macro mode, fast start up, manual zoom faster and sucks less power than motor controlled zooms, swing out LCD.  The bad points, if you get a clinker that slipped past quality control you will spend a lot of time cursing, wishing you had bought a different camera and getting substandard shots with a defective camera."",)"
"('When I went shopping for a new high quality digital camera to replace my aging Minolta 7i, I made up a list of features and functions that I wanted:1. Powered by ""AA"" batteries.  I dislike proprietary battery packs, which generally cost at least 4 times more than a set of four ""AA""\'s.2. Compact Flash Memory.  At the time, CF was the most economical memory option.  As of November 2007, CF and SD cards cost about the same, so memory type isn\'t as much of a concern.3. Ability to shoot stills and VGA video.  Only fixed lens cameras offer this, so I was not considering a D-SLR.4. 10x or better zoom lens with manual zoom ring for fine control, and ability to change zoom while shooting video (some cameras lock the zoom while shooting video).5. At least 8 megapixels.  The more resolution, the more a photo can be cropped.6. Good image quality on both stills and video.  Of course, no fixed-lens P&S; camera can compare in image quality to a D-SLR like the Canon D-40 or Sony Alpha A-700, but I needed the ability for both stills and video, which D-SLR\'s can\'t do (yet).7. RAW image capture with lots of manual control.  As it worked out, I have never used RAW other than for a few sample photos, so this requirement wasn\'t really necessary.8. 28mm wide angle.  Many cameras in this category have lenses that offer only 35mm wide angle, which can really cramp your ability to shoot large landscape features, architecture, or indoor rooms.As of November 2007, I have shot about 5000 stills and 4 hours of video clips with my S-9000, and have been pretty pleased with the image quality. Auto-Focus is reasonably fast, and usually much more reliable than the old Minolta 7i I used to use.  At ISO levels up to 200, the images are crisp and colors are very good.  ISO 400 is still pretty good, but at ISO 800 the images get too noisy to be pleasing.  The electronic viewfinder is pretty good, even in twilight conditions it\'s useable. I rarely use the LCD panel because it drains the batteries a lot faster than the EVF, but it is handy for viewing stored images and making menu selections.Other notable features of the S-9000:-Dual Media.  The camera can mount both a CF card and an XD card.  Switching between them requires a trip through about three levels of the menu, however.  I usually only use the XD card if the CF card has been filled to capacity and I am still shooting.  The XD card seems to be slower than the CF card, and I have had trouble shooting video on it.Things I like about the S-9000:-Uses ""AA"" batteries-Lots of manual controls, or just shoot Program mode if you want to go automatic.-Captures really nice VGA video, and you can zoom the lens while capturing video (some cameras lock the zoom in Video capture mode).-Still image quality as good as I have ever seen from a point-and-shoot.  Nice large lens with manual zoom control.  Manual focus (electronic focus-by-wire).-Feels good in the hand, ergonomics similar to an SLR.Some shortcomings of the 9000S:-Lousy sound quality on videos, but that\'s to be expected.  I don\'t know of ANY digital still camera that has ""good"" audio.  If you want good sound, buy a video camcorder and equip it with an external shotgun microphone.-Menu system buries some frequently used commands too deep (this is a minor annoyance).-I think that image transfer is USB-I, not USB-II.  Downloading a full 2 gig CF card takes FOREVER.  This issue can be worked around by using an external USB-II card reader.-No optical image stabilization.  The 10X zoom lens is really nice, but at full telephoto, camera shake can really fuzz out your pictures if you don\'t have a tripod.  Many super zoom cameras, even cameras in this price range, have some kind of image stabilization that moves either the sensor or a lens element to compensate for shaky hands.-When shooting video, the lens is Auto focus only; you can\'t set manual focus when shooting video.  This is a serious problem in scenes with low contrast, for example seascapes on foggy days.  When I took the camera to Alaska last May, many of the video clips I shot in Resurrection Bay on a cloudy/foggy day were ruined by the camera frequently losing focus lock and ""hunting"" back and forth to try and re-establish focus.CONCLUSION:  At the current street price of $379, the S9000 offers a lot of value, if you can live with it\'s few shortcomings (the video focus problems being the most serious).  If you need a single camera that can shoot really nice stills and VGA video, this one is an excellent choice.  For more serious photography needs, a ""real"" digital SLR with a bagful of assorted lenses will be more versatile and offer better low-light images; couple this with a high-def camcorder (The Canon HV20 is getting rave reviews) and you will have all bases covered, but at a price of at least several thousand dollars more than the S9000 will cost you.  Even if you are a serious D-SLR owner already, the S9000 could be a valuable back-up camera for use in environments or situations where you might not want to risk damage to more expensive equipment.****UPDATE: June 9, 2009. The Manual Control dial on my S9000 has failed. Without it, the camera is now only functional in full Auto or Program AE modes. The loss of this control dial has effectively crippled the camera; without it, I can\'t use Shutter or Aperture Priority, can\'t set exposure compensation levels, can\'t use multiple exposure bracketing, and can\'t change about a dozen other settings that are now stuck at the factory defaults. Sending the camera in for service would cost at least $150, and there\'s no guaranty that this problem could be repaired for less than the purchase price of, say, a brand new Canon SX-1is, so I guess, after 6500 photos taken, my S9000 will be relegated to the museum drawer where I keep my ancient film cameras including an early 70\'s Pentax Spotmatic.',)"
"('To get a camera better than this one you will have to spend at least US$ 120.00 more, but will loose some great features (like the ISO range) this one has. If it had Image Stavilization (IS), 12x zoom and a bigger screen, it would beat any camera on the market.PROS AND CONS.I made my own extensive research on this camera, i even posted it in some forums, if you search for this words ""All about Fujifilm Finepix S5200"" you will find it. From all the reviews i had read I recompiled this PROS and CONS from this camera:PROS:-Very fast shutter (true) and startup (true). (Speed is obviously one of the best features of this camera)-It takes very Sharp pictures.-Great low light performance. (it definitely can see more than me in the dark)-Great control of noise on high ISO.-Fast Auto Focusing.-Capable of getting photos of fast moving subject without blur.-Long Zoom. (yes, too bad is not the longest, other cameras have 12x)-Real color, meaning low saturation (distortion) of color. (it\'s true, some will find this good, others not)-Good ergonomic, the camera feels great in your hands. (And it looks pretty good too)-Light weight. (other cameras in the super zoom category are quite heavy)-Very customizable settings (nice manual control, except for the manual focus)-Many photography modes to choose from.-Low batteries consumption (very true)-Doesn\'t use proprietary batteries but 4 AA.-Auto focus assist light.(A powerful one)-RAW Mode, for those who like post-processing.-Auto pop up flash. (Some people find this better to be manual)-Good Video recording with sound.-Excellent price-performance relation, a turning point for many buyers.-Well built, great quality construction. (for most of the people)CONS:-Grainy picture (because this camera likes selecting high ISO in auto setting)-Use XD picture card which is more expensive (Most of times true) and has slower transfer rate (haven\'t notice it)-No Image Stabilization. (Many people state it\'s not needed because the high ISO and speedy shutter, my idea is this combination is called Anti-Blur. Others claims I.S. is better than Anti Blur. I suppose the combination of both would be the best)-Difficult menu. (I don\'t think so)-RAW mode is hided in the set-up menu. (yes, it should be in the F button menu)-Too slow manual focus. (true, it\'s better to half press the shutter button and let the camera do the focusing)-Bulky. (as most of the super zoom cameras are, but I find it smaller than what it looks in the pictures)-Weak flash. (average)-Small LCD. (I would say average size)-No swivel LCD screen. (Definitely it is a useful option, I think the S9000 / S9500 have something like it, but it\'s pricy. The Canon\'s S2 and S3 are the only competitors having this option, but for higher cost and some limitations compared to the S5200)-Viewfinder don\'t have enough resolution (maybe the EFV doesn\'t have great resolution, but it has enough)-No flash hot shoe. (being able to use an add-on flash would had pleased some user not happy with the built-in flash)-Only 3 pictures in continuous shot. (It has a burst mode, all pictures you can take, but at a slower rate)-Not great software, specially the CCD-RAW conversion software.-Lag between shot when using the flash. (Like most cameras)-Made in china, for some reason Chinese are famous for having quality issues. Seems like because the globalization we will have to get used to it. Other Fujifilm cameras were made in Japan and showed great quality and durability; Hope this one does it too. (Should it be considered CONS?)-Battery compartment is a little difficult to close. (nothing you can\'t get used to)',)"
"(""My first ADS unit arrived DOA from Amazon, probably damaged in shipping, and it would not be recognized by my video editing machine (AMD 3000+, 2GB RAM, 500GB SATA HDD).  My second ADS unit arrived 3 days later, Amazon has very good customer service, I'll give them that much, they refunded my $3.99 I paid for super-saving 1-day shipping and sent the unit out overnight delivery, since I needed this to finish a project.  Kudos to Amazon.Ok, the tale of the tape: This item DOES NOT seamlessly integrate with my NLE software (Premiere Pro 1.5) nor does it work seamlessly with the free copy of Adobe Elements 2.0 that comes with it.I went to the ADS tech support website for a firmware or driver update, and there are none to be found.  I have had the unit hooked up to my machine for a few hours, and have only been able to capture one piece of video without any incident.  I downloaded ADS's proprietary capture program (WMCAP.EXE - 0.6MB), which worked for one clip, then crashed.I have restarted my machine over and over, and usually have to unplug the firewire cable to get the device to be recognized by Windows XP Home rev.2.  This thing is a piece of junk, don't buy it unless you want to be angry and disappointed.  I am an A/V professional for a living, and should have known better than to trust a $150 device over a professional one.The A/V cables that come with this device are sub-standard. You do get 2 firewire cables (6-6 and 6-4) but the 6-6 was too short to be of any use.  You literally have to mount the unit with tape on top of your computer, because it's made of plastic and will try to leap off the machine every time you unplug a cable (gaffer tape to the rescue).I am going to try ADS tech support again.  If I need to send the unit in for a firmware update as another reviewer intimated I will be returning this device to Amazon and going with a Canopus or other device from a reputable video hardware company.Caveat Emptor.5/4/07: Unit was returned to Amazon shortly after my review.  Additional online research confirmed this unit will not work with an Athlon chipset computer despite the company saying it will (error with SSE2 instructions). Their tech support staff is rude and obnoxious and blamed my lack of understanding (20 years with computers, 15 with A/V equipment), rather than their junky hardware.I'm just jumpering my DVD & VCR through my DV-Camera as a temporary solution and using the firewire out from my camera.  If you need a digital/analog conversion box, check out the Canopus brand ones and avoid anything made by ADS.  Canopus has top notch customer support and firmware upgrades and they don't talk to their customers like they are idiots."",)"

"('The concept of the product is great. All computers in my network now have access to the important files when the others are turned off. Consumes only a small amount of power (I\'ve heard 17 Watts, which seems about right) and is very quiet, unless the fan is on. I did not find this information on any reviews or on the Maxtor online help, but enabling the media server (which is off be default) will kick the fan on indefinitely until you disable the media server again. Despite being a small fan (35-40mm), I can hear it from across the room (12 ft). So I was disappointed that I couldn\'t just keep the media server on forever, effectively ruining the synergy it has with my D-Link DSM-520 media player. Also, my media player can\'t find the videos/pictures/audio I put in the NAS unless their in the pre-allocated ""My music"", ""My photos"" and ""My video"" folders, which are re-created if you delete them and then enable the media server. I used the 2 rear USB ports as a print server and to attach another external hard drive. Some people have said that the print server is slow. I\'ve only printed out small jobs and it does seem to lag sometimes. Note that since the printer is no longer attached to a dedicated computer, the printer software (ink reserve checks, diagnosis tests) are not available. Any USB hard drive/flash drive you stick onto the NAS needs to be FAT32 (according to Maxtor), otherwise you might have limited read/write access. The speed is the expected speed of a 100Mbit connection. It would have been better if they included gigabit connectivity for future-proofing.Summary: Good 10/100 Mbit NAS with print server, but issues w/media server which seems to trigger noisy fan, even if no CPU load. This negates the advantage Maxtor had on media server-less NASes for me. No gigabit connectivity. Overall, if using for basic backup and network storage, this is good and quiet. If trying to utilize everything Maxtor equipped, you\'ll find some quirks.',)"

"(""I was in search for the perfect digital camera and have gone through about 8 to 10 digital camera in the past 4 years, and Casio Z750 is the one. I started out with Canon PowerShot S40, it took pretty good pics but was big and heavy like a brick. Got a Canon S110 but auto focus was slow, then Canon SD230, Canon SD450, That's when I started to notice that images produced from Canon digital camera has a certain softness to it, I don't know how to explain it, the images got good color and looks clear but it just doesn't standout as much, and doesn't look as crisp and sharp as it should be...Also, Canon cameras has a tendency to capture dust specs in the images, meaning if you use the flash, the flash would get reflected or bounced back from the dust spec and you would get multiple round transparent ball of light in your images, and for some odd reason this only happens to Canon cameras. Anyhow, due to all those reason I have stopped getting Canon and would never buy another Canon again. My next camera was Pentax S3 (images were sharp but too much artifacts), then Panasonic FZ5 (camera was too big to be carrying around all the time), Sony T7(camera was too small and light which makes it hard to hold it stable), Sony W1(took great pictures but a bit bulky to leave in the pocket). After all these cameras I realized the camera I need to look for was an ultra compact. Why? Because I want to take spontaneous pictures when-ever and where-ever, while not strapping the camera around my neck, or the need to carry a man-purse just for the camera. If you want to take wonderful professional pictures and like fiddling with the camera setting, then your best bet is a Digital SLR. Mid-sized & Ultra-Zoom camera are for those people that want a SLR but can't afford it. But for all other occasions ultra compact is the way to go. One thing you need to know about ALL Ultra compact camera is that there are trade offs for the size. Ultra compact camera have limited flash rang and a high potential to take blurry pictures if you don't have steady hands (they are so light and small, if you press the shuttle too hard it will shake the camera and thus blurring the picture). But would you rather have spontaneous pictures even though some might be blurry or no pictures at all?I personally think the Casio Z750 is the perfect weight and size for an ultra compact which can be held steady enough that it minimizes blurry pictures. (If you are getting lots of blurry pictures, its not the camera, its YOU! And no matter which camera you buy or exchange it with you will still get blurry pictures, but the bigger the camera the easier it is to hold it steady and the less blurry pictures you will get.)This casio also got the best battery life out of all ultra compacts. The images are super sharp and crisp under the correct lighting and it produced the best images out of all the digicams I've used. (color saturation is higher than normal but that can be fixed within the menu to your personal liking) Since the flash rang is short it can not shoot good pictures in dark room where the subject is too far away, but this is true for all ultra compacts. The Casio z750 also uses SD media. One thing I hate about Sony is their use of MemoryStick. They are more expensive and only Sony uses it. Olympus also uses a proprietary format (XD or something). I prefer having one type of media that I can use across board with all my electronics and wouldn't cost me a fortune. SD memory is just more versatile, cheaper and wide-spread. Casio z750 also got lots of manual control option, that is great but its something I'll probably never use since it's got about 23+ scenes that you can choose from which already optimize the setting to take the best picture. All in all this is the best ultra compact camera as of Feb 2006."",)"
"(""We bought this camera so we would not have to take our larger Coolpix 8700 on a cruise to Alaska. I knewthe scenery would challenge the camera as well as the shots inside our ship. The S1 functioned perfectly. Itook pictures at a few family events to familiarize myself with it. I just set it on program mode and did nottry to adjust for various light situations. We took pictures on glaciers, in staterooms and from planes andhelicopters. The only two problems I had was my own impatience waiting the moment it took to autofocus. Ihave had the same problem with all three Coolpix cameras I have owned as well as my F100 and F5. I alsoforgot where the lens was several times and have a few shots of my out of focus index finger. The zoomfeature is amazing and seems to do much better than the 3x advertized. The optics on this camera areexcellent.The S1 is not a professional camera, however I took several pictures that I will have no hesitation in framingand could probably sell if I wanted. I would highly recommed it if a person wants one digital camera whichcan be taken anywhere and give excellent results. I would not recommed it as an only camera if one is aserious ameteur. Another limitation is that the flash is relatively short range. What can one expect of a smallcamera? I did have some red-eye, but did not use the camera's red-eye reduction system. The software I useeliminates red-eye easily, so I decided not to use the reduction feature.I recommend using the small strap included with the camera. I never had a problem, but it seems like itmight be easy to drop. For an added $100 or so, one can buy a waterproof version of this camera (S2). We didn'thave any problem in rainy Alaska, however.I am not familiar with the smaller camera made by other companies. They may be very good. I have been aNikon user since my Nikkormat days.

"('This (60 Gb iPod Photo) is my second iPod (the first, a G4 40Gb was pickpocketed from my napsack in the NYC subway - beware) and I\'ve had it over a year.  Looking over the spate of recent negative reviews here prompted me to respond.  Most of the shrieking pans and drooling raves are divorced from reality.  I think it\'s important to point out that iPod is a tool and only a tool - a portable music player - a compact digital device with much in common with a laptop computer.  It is highly configurable and the user has many choices about how to encode music - which affects the final results a great deal.1) About scratching.  The front of the iPod is shiny plastic. You\'ll need to put it in a protective case.  There is an extremely lively aftermarket.  I bought a nice silicon case with a compliant plastic panel that covers the display for $12 on Ebay.  It does the trick and a year later my iPod looks like new if I take it out of the case.  A protective case must be considered manditory for an iPod.  That\'s it - now get over it.2) All hard drive based devices of any kind - iPods included -  have limited G-force tolerance.  If you jog, it will go into protection - (the music stops and unit appears paused until you hit ""play"" again).  If you drop it while it\'s running, you might kill it - or cause disk damage that will require a reformat.  If you want a player for jogging or sporting (skiing, skateboarding etc...) buy a Nano or a shuffle or competing solid state player.  Memory chips have no moving parts and don\'t suffer these limitations.  They just have the size limitation.3) All electronic devices are subject to RF interference - especially digital devices.  The iPod has a nice metal body shield, but it can crash when taken near power lines, radio transmitters etc...4) Sonically all MP3 players will vary in quality based on how much encryption you choose to use.  For best sound use a high bit rate (192K or above).  Apple offers proprietary schemes that offer higher performance.  Competing open standards exist for just about every format Apple has cooked up.  Is this skeevy of Apple?  Perhaps.  It\'s similar to what Microsoft did on computers.  Love it or hate it - it\'s part of the whole Apple experience.  I use Apple\'s lossless compression and it works seamlessly with iTunes and yields wonderful high quality rips.  Are they portable with any other deivce than the iPod?  No.  Do they work with any software other than iTunes?  No.  Am I complaining?  Not yet!  I personally think the iTunes software is the best software and the iPod is the best player.  Down the road if the proprietary format limits me from doing something I want to do I might start complaining.  Life is full of compromises and choices.5) You must turn off equalization if you care about sound quality.  Sadly this is true of every portable digital player currently extant in the world.  I was expecting better with Apple - but it\'s not so.  Every single equalization setting introduces audible distortion that ruins the experience for an audiophile like me.  With EQ set to off I get wonderful sound.6) About reliability and dealing with broken players - portable electronics take a lot of abuse.  Laptops have shorter warranty periods than desktops because rapidly spinning hard drives don\'t tolerate motion well.  This is exactly the situation in the ipod.  It\'s a tough environment for a hard drive.  There is a lively after-market for hard drive replacement services.  Ambitious folks can buy cheap replacement hard drives on the open market and fix/upgrade their iPods.  Sure you\'ll scratch the case getting it open - but it\'s better than a dead iPod.  Battery life issues - same situation.  If you like to tinker you can do this for little cost.  If you are paying for the service it becomes more justifiable to just buy a new unit.  Is this cost effective?  Nope.  But if you become addicted to the wonderfuly lifestyle of having one of these players - you\'ll do it.7) Audible distortion of the Photo iPod becasue of the video jack?  Maybe on early units.  I have one and don\'t have any audible distortion when the EQ is off.  This unit sounds noticeably better than my 40GB G4 iPod did.  It has better battery life too.8) What about music services?  It\'s a totally personal opinion - but I don\'t recommend buying music on iTunes or any other service.  They all pretty much use relatively severe mp3 compression.  Buy the CDs and get full resolution.  Then rip at your choice of compression.  That way you have a full backup and you get all the music you pay for.  I also feel that music appreciation sometimes takes time.  There are many songs on albums that I didn\'t initally like, but grew to love over time simply because I had them because they were on the album with some more accessible hit.  If we only buy the hits - we never get to know the more difficult songs and we end up shallower.I\'ll confess I\'m a dyed in the wool audiophile - the kind who hangs sonex on his walls and puts specially made sound reflecting pillows on his ceiling.  I\'m also, like a lot of audiophiles, opposed to digital equipment in general and prefer the warmer fuller sound of analog sources (like my very tricked out turntable).  That being said - the system that shows you the most is the one you use most often - and for me that is the portable.  For years I had high-end cassette tape walkmen, then portable CD players of various stripes.  The iPod completely blows away all previous portables by a WIDE margin.  The iPod sounds way better than most stand-alone CD players - the sonics are comparable to a really good DVD player playing CDs.  This is a killer sounding portable when used with lossless compression, and etymotic ER-6 headphones.  It has better resolution than my big rig (Rocksan Xerxes turntable, Audio Research pre and amp, and ProAc Repsonse speakers).  Granted this is digital - so the highs are more brittle and there\'s less warmth and depth.  This is highly dependent on source material.  Recent recordings by good engineers sound great - through the headphones or played on a stereo system with a good cord via a line out from the cradle.  I get around 1500 songs - about 135 albums worth on my 60gb.  The iPod is high enough sonically that it can function as my test source for critical listening of back-end components or sharing music with audiophile friends at their house (on their big rigs).  This ""library"" aspect is the biggest feature of the iPod - and is really life changing.  I can\'t recommend it highly enough.My main complaint with the iPod is with the headphones.  The included headphones are not adequate for musically satisfying listening.  I recommend Grado or Etymotic headphones (even the bottom of the line ones).  You don\'t need a separate headphone amp - unless you source material is unusually low volume.  ""Earbud"" type phones are all garbage - avoid them like the plague.  Other than that - I\'m a really happy camper with the iPod!',)"

"('These headphones have been, by and large, well described by other users in this forum, so I will not spend much time here on how they look and feel, etc. Suffices to say that these are closed-back (over-the-ear) headphones, they are quite large, fairly light (they are made entirely of plastic and rubber), they do squeak and rattle at times but overall they seem to hold-up quite well to abuse and (at a first glance) they do look more expensive than they are. The pair I\'m reviewing here was bought locally some time ago (at Sears, for the original MSRP of $29.99) and may now have anywhere from 200-250hr of use on them.  In any case, this review together with the frequency response graphs I uploaded up-there is an attempt to describe the performance of these headphones in a somewhat less subjective manner. [Note: The procedure and the hardware employed in the measurement of the sound pressure level (SPL) were described in detail in my review of the ATH-A900 headphones, and I will not repeat that here. Those interested can go and read about it there.]First, the MDR-XD200 headphones have these switches on each of the cans which can change between a ""Music"" and a ""Movie"" mode/sound. So one goal here was to determine what is the difference between the two sound modes. Many reviewers in this forum have concluded (just by listening) that the two modes are identical. This is, in fact, a fair conclusion. The sound meter reveals that the ""Movie"" mode enhances (in a somewhat consistent manner) the SPL in the 80-800Hz range by 1-2dB. But that\'s about it (so, in practical terms, changing from music to movie - indeed - makes little to no difference). The second goal was to actually get some idea what the frequency response of these cans is. As can be seen in the graphs up there, these phones work fairly well in the 40-10,000Hz range. The mid-bass to lower mids region (60-400Hz) is enhanced and has a fairly large bump (9dB) at 80-100Hz, and in the highs, the response falls off the cliff at about 10kHz and never comes back up. While the response in the mids and up to the lower treble is, frankly, not bad at all, the exaggerated gain in the mid/upper bass (at 100Hz) has the effect to drown out the lower-mid region and lends a thumping quality to the sound. Also shown in the graph, at 30Hz, the SPL is down 20dB and thus bass extension is, in-effect, non-existent. In addition, the bass of these headphones is somewhat loose (poorly controlled). Perhaps more importantly, the better part of the highs (11-20kHz) is severely attenuated (e.g. at 12kHz, the SPL is already down 17dB) and shows little signs of rebound (note that the sound meter I used is only good to about 12.5kHz but subjective listening tests with pure sine tones {and comparison with the ATH-A900} shows this to be the case). This across-the-band attenuation of the high frequencies results in a muffled quality to the sound from these headphones, with little detail, and a constricted sound stage, rendering the whole listening experience somewhat un-involving.  Certainly, some improvement can always be obtained with the use of equalization (where available). On the plus side, the measurements show that the channel balance is pretty good. In conclusion, I\'d say that the MDR-XD200 is not the best for listening to music (even with EQ) but is quite acceptable for movies, games, etc. and at $30 it is, in my opinion, a solid 4-star.The second graph up there shows a comparison of the response of MDR-XD200 with that of the more expensive Audio-Technica ATH-A900 (also closed headphones, over-the-ear, and with angled drivers) both measured with the same meter in the same way. This is perhaps an unfair comparison (the Sony is a $29.99 headphone at original MSPR while the Audio-Technica was $249.95) but I already mentioned these cans above and the measurements of the ATH-A900 were available, so why not? Despite the lower bass sensitivity and the dip there between 100-200Hz, the ATH-A900 has a more balanced response. In addition, the Audio-Technica has better bass impact and presentation (i.e. the bass is more controlled), better bass extension, a more focused mid-range, good highs/highs-extension and significantly better staging. So, without a doubt, while not completely neutral or transparent either, the ATH-A900 is the more refined and engaging musical performer of the two. To summarize, for sound quality, build quality, comfort, portability and value I\'d break things down like this:Bass Extension: 3/10Bass Impact: 5.5/10Bass Texture: 5/10 (somewhat flabby/fluid)Mids Quality: 6.5/10Highs Extension: 2/10Highs Quality: 3.5/10 (dull)Highs Texture: 5/10 (slightly grainy)Detail/Transparency: 4/10 (rather veiled)Dynamics: 5/10 (fairly compressed)Soundstage: 5/10Imaging: 4/10Other:Isolation: 6/10 (closed design)Build Quality: 7/10Comfort: 8/10Portability: 3/10 (large size)Improvement w/ Amplification: 3/10 (Note: It can be easily driven by portable devices to fairly loud levels.)Value at MSRP: 7/10The MDR-XD200 is an okay pair of cans at the original asking price (but certainly much less so at $59)* which is adequate for movies, TV, games, internet radio, mobile devices (not really for portable use though due to their large size).(...)* at $60-70, there are better alternatives (also from Sony) e.g. MDR-V6 ($68), MDR-V55 ($67), MDR-ZX600 ($60)',)"

"(""The first two paragraphs are an addendum made after two months of use.  The mouse works as described when fully charged.  But as the battery wears down, it starts to gradually lag, with delayed, dragging movements and fading of the cursor.  Unfortunately, I find this happening within 48 hours of charging, compared with the week I could go with the last mouse.I am also finding that the keyboard occasionally malfunctions after reboot.  The caps lock will report that it is off but typing will all be in caps.  Some of the buttons won't work.  Rebooting and allowing the pc to completely finish the reboot cycle before using the keyboard solves the problems.I bought the MX3100 desktop set to replace my two year old LX700 that I thought was the best mouse ever (and I've tried about 50 in the past two decades). I rarely remembered to put the 700 mouse back in its charger so about once a week it would run out of power and I had to switch to a backup mouse while the 700 charged overnight. Whenever that happened, I sorely missed the cruise button. The keyboard with that desktop set was fine but I didn't use any of its special buttons except volume.Installation of the MX3100 was straightforward if you follow the guide. Took me about ten minutes. I installed only the software necessary to change the settings (first choice on installation list) and had no problem with spyware. I use other media software so I didn't need or want anything else on their installation CD.Although the cruise button and the extremely smooth and precise movement of the mouse alone make this mouse exceptional, the other bells and whistles add little in the way of necessary functionality. The zoom and scroll function will be useful with Photoshop. The scroll buttons on the keyboard and mouse may be redundant but their usefulness will be determined later when I am editing photos.I'd might use more of the keys on the keyboard if I could program them to work with my software. I use one of four different applications when burning CDs or DVDs but I don't use the only software that works with this keyboard. I also have created buttons on my start menu to access all of my media so it requires equal effort to punch a button on the keyboard or a button on the start menu.I really wish I could program the function keys with macros that included typing in multiple characters (like passwords).An important point that I only learned through trial and error is that you have to leave the quick-launch button active in the Windows XP Notification Area (aka system tray in the bottom righthand corner of the taskbar). If you turn it off like I did, functions like cruise and application switch quit working.If money is tight or your computing activities don't include serious gaming, get the LX700. Otherwise, this may be a very good choice for you."",)"

The problem is that the display is not optimized for scrolling, so while the scrolling is happening, the text is an illegible blur. Why don't they just jump the display in one blip to the new position instead of making the whole thing illegible during the scrolling. They'd get the same end result without preventing the user from reading the song title while it's scrolling. Grrr!-The latest update to the software is months old. They appear not to be fixing any of the bugs because they're busy making the next generation in order to bilk more unsuspecting users out of several hundred bucks.-I have been scouring Apple's documentation and web for a way to get a hold of a human either by email or phone. No luck. There's a paid support option which costs a significant fraction of what a new iPod costs.-They say 12 hours battery life. That must be downhill with a tailwind. Mine gets 5, less if I use the interface a lot. You can't change the battery yourself (actually, there are now third-party options for this) but Apple will charge you $100 to do it. Oh, and if your iPod is monogrammed (mine is) you'll find that they send you back a different iPod when you change the battery. Your monogrammed one vanishes into the void.-The system is volume-limited to the least common denominator to protect me from myself. It's barely loud enough, even using efficient ear buds, to make me sway to the rhythm. I had to spend $200 on a third-party headphone amp just to get the volume up to party level.-It's extremely fragile. Don't drop it or you'll be sorry!-Two nice things: the sound, what there is of it, is pretty good, and iPods are great fashion statements.Save yourself the disappointment and buy an iRiver H340 instead of an iPod."",)"
"('I\'ve used this headset for over 3 years now.  There are plenty of good things about it, but also plenty of bad things depending on the user.  Overall it makes this headset average at best in my opinion.** THE GOOD- The quality of the headset is fairly good.  3 years of heavy gaming use and it is still operating good as new.  In fact the headset itself looks fairly new as well.  The padded ear cushions are still as fluff and soft as out of the box.- The microphone is located on the RIGHT side and produces a fairly good quality signal- Plug-n-Play works great!  Not one problem on Windows XP SP2/SP3 or Vista- Audio quality of the speakers are fairly good.  Audio comes out crystal clear and reproduction is pretty decent quality nearly equal to that of a decent sound card- LED indicator to let you know if you have Power (solid blue) or are Muted (Flashes)- Adjustable headband** THE BAD- While the USB cable is thick and sturdy; the cable leading from the right side to the ""soft touch"" control is thin.  While it works fine it doesn\'t seem sturdy enough to handle being pulled on or accidentally tugged so handle with care!- Soft touch feature is really SOFT TOUCH.  In fact, you might bump against the mute button (which happens to be 90% of the soft-touch button panel) and mute yourself without even realizing it.  A simple \'beep\' notifying you a button had been pressed would of been nice.** THE UGLY- If you wear glasses (like myself) you might have a small problem.  While the earmuffs themselves are fairly comfortable they do fit ""snug"".  This can cause them to press your ears into the branches of your glasses and lead to headaches or just discomfort....To remedy this problem you can either slip a cotton ball between your branch and ear.  Depending on your glasses, lift the branch slightly so it isn\'t behind the ear.  OR wear the headset loose instead of securing it to your head.  (leave some play in the adjustment)** OVERALL perhaps 3 years ago this was a good headset to own.  It is a simple headset which does its job well, and outside of my concerns with the thin connecting cable from the ""soft touch"" to the earpiece, the headset is built to last.  The audio quality is decent and the speaker quality is exceptional for the price.  I do not regret my purchase one bit (back in 2007).  HOWEVER, this is 2011 and there are better alternatives on the market now; especially for someone with glasses and multiple gaming systemsWith that in mind... I recommend the X11 (for PC/MAC/360 owners)  or the P11 (for PC/MAC/PS3 owners)  Both products are by Turtle Beach and are in the same ballpark $-wise... If you want to splurge  get a 21 series line. (better audio drivers)',)"

"(""Hands down the best value for the money. Easy to use, very small, internal battery, and preloaded maps. A monkey can use this out of the box. Be very wary of some of the reviews on Amazon regarding GPS. Many may be by people who have a vested interest either because they work for a competitor or because they invested in or shorted the stock of the companies making these units. GPS navigation is really starting to catch on in this country and the economic stakes for the companies involved are large. These are multibillion dollar companies trying to compete in a market that is just starting, the market for portable navigation devices.Garmin makes the very best consumer GPS units in the world. They are the only GPS company that makes FAA certified integrated instrument pannels for airplanes. Do you really think they are putting out products that don't work? Garmin also has the best support I've ever experienced from any tech firm. I also own a Garmin PDA which broke and they replaced it for free outside of warrenty.This is the GPS unit that will bring GPS to the masses.  This is the first product that is easy enough for everyone to learn to use within 5 minutes.  The C series does not have all of the functions and features of the 26xx series, it doesn't show individual sat. data or lat or long, route sorting, but most of these features add little value and make the OS interface more complicated.  This is a pure GPS auto navigation unit.  For more tech savy buyers the 2600 series or iQue is a better choice.Compared to the Magellan Roadmate series, there is no comparision.  The Garmin unit is less expensive and better on every dimension.  Much smaller and lighter but with the same size screen as the 700.  Touch screen and internal battery.  Much better mounting system.  It really works well.  And a much larger POI database 5 million versus 2 million I think.  Most importantly, the Garmin is MUCH easier to use.  No one who tested both would buy the Magellan, unless they were French.The unit is so small and light it really is a marvel of engineering.  For the average Joe or Jane, this is the perfect GPS.Garmin is a great company and supports its products very well.  They provide free updates of the firmware for all their products and their customer service is first rate.  You won't be sorry if you buy this one.People who complain about the outdated maps should realize that there is a 1 or 2 year lag in adding new streets and POIs and no GPS has fully updated maps.  If you live in an area with a lot of new construction, this can be very frustrating.  Garmin provides map updates every two years or so (they are on version 6 now) for $75.  It is a lot easier and less expensive to update a Garmin handheld than a built in car nav system.  Some of Garmin competitors use maps by a different company that are very poor in comparision.  Garmin uses the best mapping data available from navteq and develops its almost 6 million POI database themselves.If you have any question about the C330, check one out in person at your local electronics shop.  You won't believe the size and ease of use.  Compare it to anything else out there and you will be buying the C330."",)"
"('Amazon\'s listing for the C330 says that ""every unit sold will come with the most recent map version"". This statement is not true.  I just got a brand new C330, which is loaded with City Navigator North America ""V8"" maps  (found by touching Map, then Map Info).  Today I visited the Garmin web site, went to the map update page, and entered my device\'s serial number. The web site told me that an update is available for my unit: ""Map Update 2008 City Navigator"".Somewhat perplexed, I called Garmin\'s customer support line and received the following explanation from Peggy.  The V8 map package was issued in June 2006. A newer mapset, version 2008, was issued in June 2007. However, the size of the improved and more detailed database in version 2008 is larger than will fit in the memory of the C330. Therefore, when you install the update, you have to choose whether you want to load the database for United States, or the one for Canada. The Canadian subset includes all of Canada plus the border states (including Massachusetts, not strictly a border state, but useful for Canadians who visit New England).If you purchase the 2008 Update, you can make the decision about which subset to load into the C330 repeatedly. So it can be updated first with the V2008 maps for the US, and then subsequently loaded with the V2008 maps for a vacation trip to Canada.  Of course, if you\'re not living in a border state, you won\'t be able to use the Canadianized C330 to navigate to Canada, but once you\'re there, you\'re all set.Should you choose to install the US portion of the database, all of the old (V8) Canadian data is deleted. Similarly, should you install the updated Canadian 2008 maps, the V8 US information is wiped. In my view, this was a poor design decision.Even though the C330 has an SD slot for expansion, it is not possible to load the US database from the 2008 update into the unit and put the Canadian database into an SD chip (or vice versa).The Map Update 2008 is $70US and is shipped on a DVD. Whichever subset of the data you choose, a PC or a Mac is required to load the 2008 update into a C330.If you want your cake and eat it too, you have to buy the complete V2008 Mapsource City Navigator North America NT map product from Garmin ($140US list). The entire North American database will fit on an SD card.Peggy was unwilling to provide me with a free update to the 2008 maps, even though I just purchased a brand-new unit that was advertised as having ""the most recent map version"". I have read elsewhere that some purchasers were able to obtain an update to 2008 maps at no charge, but Peggy would not be swayed. Her explanation, which was carefully wordsmithed by Garmin\'s marketing department, was that the V8 maps are the \'latest that were shipped from the factory\' with the C330. Thus, the unit that I purchased, in Garmin\'s opinion, is the most recent version that was offered for sale.According to Peggy, the same limitation in map storage and upgrade applies to the StreetPilot C530 version, a more modern unit that was recently discontinued by Garmin.I am now debating whether to keep the C330 or not. It\'s a nice product, and seems very easy to use. But I resent being sold a mapping device with map data from 2006, especially when it was explicitly advertised as having the most recent map data ""through April 2007"". Garmin\'s policy to then demand an additional $70 to upgrade strikes me as designed more to satisfy shareholders than customers.',)"
"('Ok, I\'m not going to give a super technical breakdown of the pro\'s and con\'s. You can read the 2xx other reviews for that. I will tell this much: c330 is a great unit for one heck of a price (299 shipped!!!). You really just take it out of the box and it\'s ready to go. First off, I\'ve never owned any GPS equipment. So even though higher models like the c340 speaks the street names, or the nuvi 350 is no bigger than a deck of cards, the c330 has everthing a gps newb needs to get around town, or across the country. US and Canda are already loaded. I really wanted the Nuvi 350 but it was out of my price range. I was considering the c320 to save more money, but with the $20 price difference (on Amazon) it was only logical to get the c330. It\'s got most major restaurants, gas stations, attractions and a bunch of other categorized POI\'s that I\'ll probably never need, but just nice to know they exist if I need them...or if I\'m bored and just want to see what other POI this thing has. As far as the voice nav goes she usually tells me to turn when it\'s at .1 mile. I think the ""turn"" prompts can be a bit sooner, but as long as you\'re aware you will be fine.  Now it would be nice if it said the actual street name, but all it takes is a quick glance to see which street she\'s talking about and you\'re on track.The text on the screen is clear and readable. I have mine mounted near the bottom of my windshield. Btw, that mount has very good suction. I don\'t know what people are talking about when they say the mount doesn\'t hold. Here\'s what some people might overlook on the mount: It\'s got a lever that is in the ""locked"" position when you get it. So what you\'ve got to do is flip up the lever to ""unlocked"". Stick it to the windshield and flip the lever down to ""locked"" and that thing will be on there nice and tight! To take it off, just work it in reverse and off it will come.There are a few things I noticed. Almost all routes chosen where the ones my fiance would choose (she\'s the Baltimore local not me). I have mine set to Fastest Route , but some destinations have me take a turn too early or go around. Case in point, I went to Costco today and was told it was right if off the highway, but the c330 told me to go right basically making one big circle. It was just a couple minutes extra so no big deal. Now if I was by myself I wouldn\'t have even noticed b/c I was not at all familiar with the area. So yes, there is the chance that it won\'t pick the most ideal route, but then again that Garmin route won\'t have you too far off from the route that a person familiar with the area would chose.I haven\'t tested the SD slot, but I\'ve read that it\'s pretty useless for loading custom POIs until you step up to the c530 models and higher. The SD slot does read maps for other countries so all hope is not lost if and when you plan to travel to areas outside the U.S. In order to load custom POIs you\'d need to take the c330 in with you and use the USB to plug it directly to your computer. You\'d basically load it directly onto the c330\'s internal memory. Garmin says its got 2mb of internal memory, though they didnt specify how much of that is actually used by the unit. So up to this point I don\'t know how much usuable internal memory there is. I don\'t plan to load tons and tons of POI so its doesn\'t seem to be an issue with me. What I\'ve done in the few days I\'ve used it is to look up where I want to go (on the internet) and get the address or just look it up on the c330. I\'ve saved locations that I frequent in the Favorites section so they\'ll be there when I need them.Another thing I want to mention is the size. Don\'t expect to fit this in your jeans pocket and not have people notice ;). Yes, it is small, but not Nuvi 350 small. But to get Nuvi 350 small you need to cough up about $150 more. May not seem like much more, but for those on a budget I think you can overcome the size issue. I usually keep mine in my jacket pocket where there\'s more space. I don\'t even notice it\'s there. I also carry a side bag, but I won\'t be putting it there until I get a case for it.I haven\'t had the chance to use it in direct sunlight. People say the glare is killer, but I\'m sure it\'s not anything that an antiglare screen can\'t fix. Amazon sells those too. They\'re from Boxwave if you\'re curious.So there it is. Just a few minor setbacks that can easily be overlooked or overcome with a few adjustments. It doesn\'t have all the fancy features like an mp3 player or bluetooth, but if you just want to know how to get somewhere with confidence and at the same time have some really useful functions with a well known brand you cant go wrong with the c330...btw, did I mention it\'s only $299 :)',)"
"('High-end European hifi (e.g. Cyrus for sure and I think Naim as well) use BFA type plugs like these where the centre of the pin is hollow and signal transfer is either through the middle of the plug or the outside or both.Because they are hollow, BFA plugs are quite easy to break off in the receptacles so that these Belkin plugs have screw-on ends may be seen as a boon.  However, I would have preferred the metal part of the plugs to be in one piece.

"('I bought this camera for my 10 year old son. Yes, a 10 year old as he had proved himself with his ability to shoot and care for a camera with a 2 megpixel Canon powershot.  He got frustrated however when he began to learn to print and his pictures of course never looked as good as on his LCD playback.  Our next step to teach him the value of cropping, using different functions and becoming more camera experienced was to increase processing speed and give more megapixels.  We were overwhelmed by all the positive reviews of the Z5 from not only number one from Macworld and other computer and digital camera magazines but the  expert recomendation from our camera sales person, in a family owned camera store in business for over 50 years and the sales people all own incredible amounts of cameras, most part time pro shooters, and they test personally every camera that enters the store.  I am from a family of Canon LOVERS and would not give my Canon 10D SLR up for anything but the 20D. In teaching my son this camera I found it to be an excellant camera and the macro modes were great.  The reviews I read fom the people here on amazon seem to be expecting the quality and funcitioning of a much more expensive camera not a $500, 5 megapixel. That is what we spent and I see on sale now so a great deal.  In terms of low light my son did better than I did at times inside the Monterey Aquarium where no flash is allowed.  I was truly impressesed with this camera and thought it would be fun to have for a second camera, easy to carry, and yet the budget is going towards the 20D.  I was abosolutely amazed at the negativity over the camera in the reviews.  If you want a video camera, buy a video camera.  Someone had to stand up for this camera and it is great  for ITS CLASS. Personally I would never consider buying a camera that ran from AA batteries, rechargeable or not.  Lithium only for me and only use a flash atachment, never the flash with the camera.  The truth is according to my expert who recomended this for our needs, there is no best camera of a certain class. It always depends on the type of photographer you are.  A landscape photographer will hate the camera a portrait shooter will love.  Ask not what is the best camera, go to a good store where people know somethng, tell them how and when you shoot and then come back to amazon and buy what you have talked to a knowlegable person about and have held and tried.  Find a case, see how easy you can get it out, try some shots, a good store will always allow and encourage this.  I can never, ever imagine buying a camera I have not held nor tried.  For those unhappy, step up to the SLR land and then you will be happy. Then you can make the camera be the one that fits your type of shooting.  This is a great all around camera in this class.  I have also shot the new Canon 5 megapixel powershot and this much better and that for me to say is sacra-religous in my family.  Have fun  wih the camera and make sure you keep in mind that any pro will tell you if you take a role of 36 in the film days, you are lucky if you get two or three great shots. I know I cherish my garbage can and most will tell you I am a great photographer. Helps if they only see your best!',)"
"('I echo many other reviewer\'s sentiments about the high quality Sony DCR-DVD403 camera - its great! I am quite concerned about the terrible things I have heard about Sony\'s support -- I hope I don\'t ever have to turn in my camera. Fortunately, so far my camera is working flawlessly. Some of the bundled software is a different story though -- what a disgrace! (details below)Camera Strengths:* fast startup -- just a second or so from \'off\' to \'record\'* remarkably good color, brightness and contrast, even under low light and other marginal viewing conditions -- its magic!* even when moving the camera or when shooting in a moving car I never noticed any \'skips\' or \'drop-outs\' -- very reliable* good battery life ... can record several full DVDs w/LCD viewer using one NP-FP71 (hi-capacity battery)* remarkably easy to use and effective optical zoom -- once you get the hang of it, zooming is both smooth and silent* i am a DCR novice but there\'s few shots I can\'t shoot well in the camer\'s ""EASY"" (full auto) mode -- again, magic!* if what you have shot is \'good enough\' As-Is, then the camera\'s built-in \'Finalize\' function creates a DVD that can be played in any DVD player & the auto-menu feature works fine.* the camera itself w/the \'RCA\' cable is an effective DVD player (small DVDs only), or plays un-\'finalized\' video ... the included remote is small and convenient* the included PC software to download the video clips (as MPG files) to your PC seems is pretty easy to use and works fine* the included PC software to edit your video clips -- to remove undesired portions of your video clips -- has a slick GUI and seems to work fine. It outputs new (smaller) MPG filesCamera Challenges:* nit: the disk cover occaisionally \'snags\' on the velcro strap handle -- when the cover is open the camera does not sit well on even flat surfaces and puts a stress on the LCD monitor* nit: the unnecessary multi-second ""SONY disc recommended"" message each time you boot the camera is ANNOYING. *sigh** MAJOR: their bundled ImageMixer EasyStep DVD software is -- simply stated -- terrible! Problems include:1) when the software encounters errors it often exits! you get NO error message and it simply shuts the window. what\'s up with _that_? I submit that in today\'s technology that\'s criminally negligent software behavior2) the software sometimes pukes on large clips (>100MB each) ... what\'s up with that? (100MB is NOT large for video)3) sometimes -- for no reason I could discover -- the software pukes while building the DVD image. *whatever*4) even when it works, the software does NOT allow you to define the order your clips appear on the DVD, and it has a severely limited menu building capability. *sigh*5) the software ONLY allows you to create DVDs using the camera itself, which means are stuck creating little DVDs that are only about 30 minutes long. In other words, even if you have your own DVD burner you can\'t write to that. *sigh*Unless you are creating only short, simple DVDs don\'t waste your time trying to use ImageMixer EasyStep DVD. I whole-heartedly thank N. Bennett -- see review #10 for this camera -- who suggested using the included Sony software to download and edit the MPG clips (which I do), then use TMPGEnc DVD Author 1.6 to author a DVD image using the MPG files as input. That software gives you full control over the order of the clips and how the DVD menu is structured. That was all I was looking for (i.e., it doesn\'t do video editing, a whole other story). As the final step I use Nero Express to burn the DVD (works great), but likely any DVD burning tool can be used to write your file system-based DVD \'image\' onto blank (full-size) DVDs.Bottom Line: The Sony DCR-DVD403 is a terrific camera -- I highly recommend it. But plan on using alternative software to author and burn your DVD\'s. I would have given Sony 5 stars overall but held one star back because of their simply terrible bundled DVD authoring software.',)"
"('The title of this review sounds like a cliche, but it is all true.After had some bad experiences with dlink wireless (DI524) router, I decided to go with linksys, which turned out to be even a bigger mistake. At least the dlink router is still sort of working while the linksys died the day after I purchased it.  Here are the highlights:1. the shipped firmware is version 1.2.05, which limits the PPPoE (your DSL) username to 22 characters. With companies like SBC, this may not be enough to hold your username (mine is 24). So the only way to solve it is to upgrade the firmware to 1.2.08 which specifically targets this issue.2. The upgrade of firmware is very fragil. I was upgrading the firmware and then all of the sudden the connection from my computer to the router dropped.  Then the orange light started to blink and I realized the firmware upgrade failed.3. According to the user\'s manual, a firmware upgrade failure can be recovered by using the tftp program and following the PDF instructions that ""came together with your downloaded firmware""... but there was no tftp.exe, nor any instructions.  I finally found their tftp.exe from linksys FTP site, and tried, but it didn\'t work at all.4. Linksys tech support is the worst. Most tech are foreigners and with heavy accents. the line is very busy and I was put on hold for 45 minutes before getting served. After the lady who answered the phone made me repeat my name, address and phone number and router model three times (she kept getting the numbers wrong), she started me with a census 2006 survey: Do you use DSL or cable modem, how many computers do you have, do they use windows etc. so I told her I am not here waiting for 40 minutes to do a survey.5. After telling her what happened, she kept asking about my modem. Asking about the IP of my DSL modem. I told her, the modem is not even in the picture. it was just my computer and the router, and I didn\'t even have the modem connected, but she insisted that the information would help her diagnose the problem.  so obviously she had no clue what was going on.  So I told her why didn\'t she ask me about the year and make of my car.6. Finally she gave up and started me on the the problem. She told me to poke the reset hole for 30 seconds (their manual says 8 seconds, go figure) which didn\'t make any difference. Then she asked me to ping the router (the user\'s manual had a troubleshooting section which briefly told me how to setup a static IP on my computer in order to tftp the firmware to it, I followed it, but didn\'t work). So i told her, the router was not functioning because ping gets request timed out all the time, but she told me to do that for 30 seconds, saying it might work...7. 20 minutes after my phone was answered (so i have been on the line for an hour), she finally said, based on the information you gave me and the diagnosis I asked you to do, I believe your router is broken and you should have it exchanged.  Oh, great piece of information! Why didn\'t I figure it out?8. so I took it back to the store for a refund. Does anyone make a decent working home-use 802.11g router anymore?

"('Being an ex TV DX-er, I think it\'s a shame that because of all this DTV stuff, that were now meant to be excited JUST to get LOCAL channels clearly without cable!! Be that as it may...I needed a new indoor antenna to accompany the 7"" DTV portable I got recently. The DTV antenna I previously used, the RCA 1450 Flat antenna, would not cut it so well with the new TV. The RCA also came with an optional amp unit, but that didn\'t do much to improve reception. I am 10 miles (not line of sight) away from the major towers for this area. The next problem is that 3 of our major locals, cbs, nbc & fox, are on VHF (both low & high). The rest are UHF. The RCA did ok with an older Radio Shack TV (w/a converter) but with the new TV, I couldn\'t get the aforementioned networks... not in the house anyway. I had reservations about the Terk. First, I hate amps that need plugging in. Second, I hate rabbit ears!! BUT -- finding it half-price in the store, meant it was worth a try. And, to my suprise, it does what it says!As I said, the ""ears"" are a pain... but with the VHF\'s around here, I had no choice. Anyway, with the unfortunate need to dicker with the rabbit placement, especially on low-end VHF, I CAN receive all the channels I had no hope of getting on the RCA unit. And, with the amp turned on, it does indeed stabilize the weaker channels.Other reviewers complaints are valid. The unit is top-heavy, and the stand is only good at certain angles. The VHF dipoles won\'t go forward due to the base, and only add to its ""tippiness"" when extended.At least it\'ll work w/o the amplifier, for which you won\'t need at all if you have line-of-site to towers. And assembly couldn\'t be easier.Overall, I\'d say (for me) 7 1/2 out of 10.-----------------------------------UPDATE!!! - 1 week later.I\'ve noticed something annoying over the past few days. I can only attribute it to skywave conditions (reception) unless anyone else has any knowledge or technical experience... or has experienced this themselves. On CERTAIN (digital) channels there is most often a sync problem with the audio being about 2-4 seconds BEHIND the video image. Here, I get 3 analog channels, in addition to the digitals. They are NEVER out of sync. And the digital ones that are, aren\'t uniformly out of sync. The 24/7 weather channel has a screen crawl. That crawl is ""jerky"" 90% of the time. Hense the images on the screen are also jerky in motion. The antenna is feeding a 7"" portable TV. I still have cable on my main TV. In taking the TV & the antenna in the car, I\'ve found it totally IN SYNC when positioned in an area closer to the station towers. Yesterday, even at home, they were in sync, & not jerky. Today, they\'re OUT of sync again. Just like analog TV used to be, reception varied due to skywave conditions. Of course locals were ALWAYS perfect. DTV is FAR from perfect!!',)"

"('In brief, this was the best of four indoor antennae I tried.  It picks up every station it should with just a little effort.  I may still try an outdoor unit though.Before any antenna review I should let you know the environment in which I tried it.tuner: built into a new Philips 42"" plasma, model 42PF7320A/37building: tall single story on a high basement on a hill, plaster/lathe, wood sidinglocation: residential neighborhood, mostly single family homes, lots of large tall treesterrain: Urbana, IL - flat, only a few tall buildings 1.5 miles away on campustransmitters: check antennaweb.org for details, but in summary I have close stations in multiple directions and the furthest reception desired was from Decatur, about 35 miles west.This was the fourth antenna I tried after buying a new television with built-in digital tuner.  First I tried the passive Radio Shack I\'d been using for analog.  This gave me only one digital station.  Online research led me to want an amplified unit.  Thanks to reviews here and elsewhere I wanted to buy a Terk, but found only a Jensen at first.  This was worse than the RS; I returned it and got both the TV5 and the HDTVa.  I really wanted to like the 5; I liked the appearance and so many people online say it works for them.  It was the first to give me all stations if I worked at it hard enough.  I could not repeat the results though.  I had to move it for every single station.  I don\'t just mean rotate it; I mean find a new place in the room.In contrast, it takes only two different positions for me to get everything reliably with the HDTVa.  This definitely applies to the amplified HDTVa only; I couldn\'t get a single digital station without the power injector.  Be prepared to play around; results can be counterintuitive.  One of the best and most stable results I get is with it pointing right into a south wall for a station northeast of me.Quality seems decent enough - good weight to everything.  The thick coaxial cable comes out the bottom so it can face forward or backward.  This cable is stiff, and until it settles a bit can render the antenna a little tip-prone.  It fell off a coffee table once and seems fine.  I wouldn\'t want one to drop six feet though.',)"
"(""This is a review of a few antennas and why I finally settled on the Terk HDTVa. I only tested them with ATSC signals, so I can't comment on any analog reception.I just ordered this from Amazon.com and I can say without a doubt that it's the best antenna I've ever used. I'm about 25 miles away from most TV transmitters, and it picks up all of them. I was extremely surprised and very happy to see that it also picked up NBC and FOX, both VHF channels here, at full strength, something I was never able to do with my other two antennas.I ran a longer coax cable and put the antenna on a window sill, I never have to fiddle with the rabbit ears or move it around to get a clear picture. This is on the window sill of a first floor (3 floor building) apartment that is surrounded by other apartment buildings. Also, the UHF element can be mounted with the blades oriented horizontally or vertically, perfect for putting it on the window sill and still being able to close the blinds.The only con I can think of is that the VHF elements aren't as freely moved as they are on a lot of other antennas, like on an old pair of bunny ears. Basically, if you want to aim them horizontally, they have to be pointing in the OPPOSITE direction of the UHF element, or straight up, or tilted slightly forward. Aiming them horizontally in the same direction as the UHF element is impossible. This is only a minor issue, since the reception is so damn good I could aim the VHF elements however I wanted to and still get a clear picture; this isn't even enough of a nuisance to take one star off for. DEFINITELY get this; it's the best indoor antenna you'll ever use.This is also the only antenna I've ever used that didn't lose signal on every single channel, both UHF and VHF, when someone was using a cell phone. Definitely a good perk.GE 24775 Quantum Indoor HDTV AntennaMediocre, at best. This is one of the only antennas I've seen with ONE VHF element, which isn't exactly a problem in this market since most of our DTV stations are UHF, but don't count on being able to receive more than one VHF station with this setup. You'll find yourself moving the lone bunny ear around a lot if you've got 3-4 VHF stations you want to watch, even when the transmitters for these stations are on the same tower!The UHF panel design is a gimmick at best, it does help if one station is in a different direction and you only want to aim one panel at it, but the reception for some reason is not consistent. The FIXED LENGTH power and coax cables are the nails in the coffin.This antenna would be great at $10, maybe $15, not the $30 GE is trying to sell it at. For some reason, this antenna is also very limited in how many ways you can aim the VHF element; I'd prefer being able to aim the VHF element in whatever direction I want and have limited range on the UHF element since receiving those signals is much easier.It did seem to like being placed in as high a location as possible; I'm on the first floor so it's not easy to get it very high up. When held to the ceiling reception did improve greatly, and as soon as I figure out how to staple it to my ceiling I'll find a use for it. Right now it's chugging along fine in the living room.This antenna is definitely a good choice if you're in a tall building or out in the boonies away from any other buildings. WiFi, microwaves, and cell phones only bother it on certain VHF stations, but it can barely pull those in anyways.Philips High Performance Amplified Indoor Uhf/Vhf/Fm/HDTV AntennaI used this antenna for the longest time, all while being mildly annoyed by it. First off, it pulls in UHF signals like nobody's business, regardless of how it's oriented or where it is placed. It doesn't seem to mind multipath interference at all. VHF stations are a completely different story; it takes hours and hours of messing with these rabbit ears to get any picture, unlike the other two antennas reviewed. And then when you DO finally have the picture, heaven forbid you start to move around the room or even move on the couch, the picture will drop out.I had this antenna at my old 3rd floor apartment, and tried it in two locations in my new 1st floor apartment. In the living room, I really couldn't pick up anything useful with it, so I moved it to the bedroom and tried with a Pinnacle ATSC tuner. When I finally had the rabbit ears set up right, for some reason I could no longer tune the strongest UHF signal in the area, go figure.On the third floor, the only thing I had to worry about was the fact that it was VERY susceptible to RF interference. Is anyone in a nearby apartment using a microwave or making a cell phone call? Signal drops out. Get a text message? No TV. On the first floor, you can only sit in certain spots while watching TV or you've got no picture. This was especially annoying since it was being used to record shows while I was away, the signal would get weaker without someone in the room.It just might have been my unit that was poorly shielded, but the more I turned down the amplification, the less susceptible it was to RF interference"",)"
"('My uncle recently had orthopedic surgery and was facing an extended rehab period. He has no wiring for his cable TV service in his bedroom because he normally doesn\'t watch TV in the bedroom. Since he would be confined to bed several hours a day using some medical equipment, I wanted to set up a TV for him.I placed a TV in the room and hooked up a Roku box so he could watch movies, etc. over his wireless network, but it didn\'t address his desire to watch nightly news, etc. Running the channel scan to search for over the air channels picked up nothing at all. After reading the great reviews on the Terk HDTVa, I ordered one.This antenna is amplified so you\'ll need to place it near an electrical outlet and you\'ll need some space on a table to place the unit. (If you\'re using it with a converter box on an old, tube-style TV, you can set it on top of the TV.) Near a window is optimal for receiving the most channels with the best reception.Installation is simple and the included users manual is very clear and helpful. Out of the box, you insert the UHF receiving element (the part with all the little blades) into the main unit. You can insert it oriented in two different ways, which is something to remember in case you aren\'t receiving some channels clearly. Put together, it resembles a big ray gun from a 50s sci-fi film, but it\'s not hideous looking.Next, connect the cable from the HDTVa antenna to the Power Injector terminal labeled TO ANTENNA. Then, connect the TO TV cable on the Power Injector to the ANT/AIR IN or VHF/UHF port on your TV or set-top box. Plug the power adapter from the Power Injector into an electrical outlet. Turn the tiny switch on the Power Injector to ""ON"" for amplification. (You can use the antenna without the amplification on, but it still needs to be plugged in to function.)Point the antenna out the window or in whatever direction is necessary to receive the strongest signals. On the Terk website, you can input your street address and it will tell you what direction is best from your location. Also, extend the ""rabbit ears"" to further fine tune your reception.Now, run your channel scan on your TV, being sure to select ANT or OVER THE AIR rather than CABLE. If you don\'t pick up as many channels as you think you should, you can reposition the antenna and rescan as many times as necessary.In my uncle\'s case, I just pointed the antenna out the window and the scan picked up 69 channels with all but one having a perfect picture! He lives in a major metropolitan area so that may account for the large number of channels picked up, but we were still astounded at the number and the clarity of the picture on all the channels. It took me all of 15 minutes from opening the package to running the channel scan.Your mileage will probably vary depending upon where you live and what kind of obstructions are between you and the closest tower but for $40, I think it is a brilliant solution to a room with no cable access or even ditching your cable TV service all together.',)"

"('The ""Superdrive"" on my two-year-old desk-top iMac with 17"" flat-panel simply died on me a month ago, in effect putting my audio-video life on hold.  No time to pack and ship out the cumbersome machine for repair, so for less than the price of one of those little Apple power adapters with the folding prongs, I ordered this Memorex drive.  It\'s a bit larger and heavier than I\'d anticipated, but it\'s certainly sturdy and well-equipped: a two-part long-reaching power supply and cord, a USB as well as a Firewire cable depending on your preference (Apple doesn\'t even include one with a new computer), and a stand for vertical, space-saving use of the drive.  I simply plugged it in, connected the Firewire cable, inserted a DVD, and that was all there was to it.  For the first time in weeks, I saw a disc on my computer\'s desk top.Next test: I inserted a blank CD into the Memorex, selected 70 minutes worth of tunes from my iTunes library, clicked on ""burn CD.""  This produced the following question: ""Your preferred recording drive is not available.  Would you like to use the external Memorex drive?""  I clicked ""yes,"" waited no more than 3-4 minutes, and a spanking new CD was born.  I had planned to use the Memorex as a temporary device, until time and energy would allow me to have the iMac Superdrive repaired.  Obviously, a bad idea.  Stick with the Memorex for another year, by which time the iMac will be out of date and worthless.A lot of software comes with the drive, but with iTunes, Roxio Toast, Sound Studio, and other clutter already installed on my machine, I doubt it\'ll see any use.  Still, if it\'s as efficient and user-friendly as the drive, it could be a huge bonus for some owners.[I\'m surprised about the negatives concerning the above.  This relatively inexpensive device was frankly a life-saver.  I still haven\'t read the manual or installed a thing, and it continues to burn files in my iTunes folder and function with my iMac like it was made for that purpose. I haven\'t tried burning a DVD or an MP3 disc, so I can\'t make any claims about those functions as yet.]',)"
"('Recently i\'ve been getting into portable audio. This has happened because someone lives in the basement of the house i\'m living in... and she\'s a complete b..., well, um... ""brat"", so I don\'t get to jam my home stereo as often as I would like.Anyways, to get to the point, I decided that i\'m gonna buy a good pair of headphones (Grado SR-80, check out my review) - and also i wanted to get a good portable CD player because MP3 players are a bit out of my current price range. After reading many reviews all over the net, I decided to go ahead and get this CD player.First, the good...I really like the parametric equalizer. I haven\'t owned a portable CD player in awhile, so this is a first for me. I am picky about sound and initially I was disappointed with the sound this player produced (I think the presets kinda suck). I then discovered how to use the parametric equalizer - then I was able to get the sound I was looking for... well close anyways. I also like how easy this thing is to use. The learning curve is relatively small, especially if you just take a quick browse through the instruction manual, also there are a few little on-screen tips just in case you forget. The construction seems pretty sturdy, although I haven\'t dropped this player - yet. The buttons have a good snap to them, also. Also worth mentioning is the fact that you only need 1 AA battery, and it will last for a good while. Oh yeah, the FM/AM/TV/Weather feature is also pretty cool, most other portable CD players i\'ve owned in the past are just that... CD players. This player also plays MP3s and Atrac3 files, which is common now-a-days (MP3 anyway), but still a plus.And then the not so good:There isn\'t too much to complain about, but what\'s there is a little annoying. First, the display is a bit hard to read if you\'re not in a really well lit room. The biggest downside however, relates to the sound quality. Yeah, like I said above, it\'s good... it\'s better then most other players i\'ve owned in the past anyways, but this player just doesn\'t produce the sound-stage my home stereo produces. When I plug my phones into my home stereo I get very crisp eye-blinking highs, smooth mids and thumpin\' lows. With this player I get so-so highs, okay mids and decent lows. Also, this player doesn\'t drive my headphones like my home stereo does. After playing this player all day, i\'ll go home and plug my phones into my stereo and it\'s on a whole other level. This player will start to distort around 3/4 of it\'s full volume. I have tried virtually every possible setting you can have on this player to try and match my stereo, but it just can\'t be done... I just can\'t get the same drive and sound-stage. I guess I just figured that by now, quality portable CD players would match that of a decent home stereo... I\'m being pretty picky though, most people will really enjoy this player. Also, if you have a headphone amp you will get more drive, but this is at least a $150.00 investment.All in all I\'m satisified, but not in aw.',)"
"(""Nexus:TJI combines the very best aspects of role playing, RTS, and strategy gaming into a uniquely wonderful gaming experience.Probably the best way to describe Nexus:TJI is 'Babylon 5' meets computer gaming. A mix of Homeworld and Star Fleet Command is another apt analogy. You command anywhere from a single vessel to a sizable fleet in an amazing amalgamation of RTS and tactical gaming. The gameplay, cinematics, and world are similar to the look and feel of `Babylon 5' including the Newtonian-based space combat. Yet it also combines the best aspects of space combat in `Battlestar Galactica' (the new series), `Star Wars', and `Star Trek'. Anyone with an interest in space combat will be very pleased with this game.The graphics in the game are outstanding. The ship models are very well done but the 'space terrain' you fight in is even better. Asteroids, planets, sun flares and more are marvelously rendered with great lighting and shading. Sound is also well done. The story is solid and interesting and offers more depth if you care to read the diary entries and character bios. Voice acting throughout ranges from good to excellent.Gameplay starts with bits of the story and a mission briefing. You are then left at the Starmap to outfit your ships, check on crew, read diary entries (more story plot), and generally get yourself ready for action. As an indicator of the overall quality of the game this section is almost a great game in its own right. The Starmap lets you literally explore the Universe like an astronomer. You can browse around solar systems and look at planets and moons. The game begins in our own solar system so you'll have some familiar surroundings from which to start.Once you leave the Starmap and start your mission the main game begins. The game plays out in real-time but you can pause the game to give orders at any moment. What is so unique is that the game blends three levels of detail into an amazing and seamless whole. At the highest level it is similar to a regular RTS game (without the resource gathering) where you can just command your units as you would in Homeworld. But there is also another deeper level where you can exert direct control of certain units and do things such as launch fighters, assign specific target points, dictate posture, etc. Yet there is a third level to the game where you can dig one step deeper and take very detailed control of certain units and assign energy distribution, repair systems, control detailed movement orders, and much more. Best of all is that you can play the game successfully at the level YOU enjoy most. On occasion you'll need to dig down (or with the larger battles back up) but mostly you can play at the level of detail and control you enjoy. These multiple levels really set the game apart from previous space combat games. You are not stuck at one level but can move up and down in detail as appropriate.All of the various ship types (fighters, capital ships, alien ships) and actions (boarding actions, energy management, and more) you would expect (and want) in this type of game are present. The ability to pause the real-time action makes Nexus:TJI a great tactical combat game that rewards sound tactics and understanding of your units' strengths and weaknesses and not just an exercise in how fast you can click. The AI is quite good and certainly doesn't do anything overtly foolish. The game's first couple of missions ease you into play and provide tutorial tips along the way. This is almost enough to play the game but you'll be best served spending some time with the well done manual as you it details some wonderful features not discussed in the in-game tips.The game interface is a study in elegance and efficiency. Most of it is immediately intuitive and the rest easily digested after a read through the manual. There is an incredible amount of information displayed in a clean, useful fashion that greatly adds to the enjoyment and atmosphere of the game. You can easily command your ships, see ship status, and information on enemy ships. Many of your actions can be assigned directly with the interface without the need to hunt around for particular ships in the 3D display.So far the game has been very stable and runs just fine at high resolution with full effects.If all of that wasn't enough Nexus: The Jupiter Incident also includes Mod Tools that lets you create not only new missions but whole new ships and solar systems! I have little doubt we will see many player-created missions available on the Web. This feature gives Nexus:TJI incredible play life. Considering the quality and depth of play I suspect we will see some of the best experiences come from Mod created missions. With luck the designers will produce not only expansions but mission and/or world packs as well.If you have any interest in sci-fi combat games or the space action in movies/series such as `Babylon 5,' `Battlestar Galactica,' `Star Wars,' or `Star Trek' you simply can't miss this game!"",)"
"(""I resisted getting a universal remote for some time because of the confusingly-large number of keys sported by most, while at the same time I expected a universal to have all the keys found on each device's original remote. The Kameleon solves the first problem by displaying only those keys appropriate for the device in use. The second objection went away when I realized you do not have to duplicate every key for every device, only those you actually use routinely -- leaving the original remote for one-time or occasional things like setting up a DVD player.Kameleon cleverly avoids key clutter by hiding an array of lighted buttons beneath a translucent blue membrane. When the user selects a device by pressing its symbol, only the keys used by that device are visible, making it easier to find the keys you need. For example, transport controls (play, pause, etc) are visible for CD, DVD and VCR, but not for TV.A sound punch through feature can link the volume buttons to the receiver no matter which source device is in use. This can be selectively unlocked for a given device, so that CD, DVD or VCR volume is controlled by the receiver, but the TV, for example, has its own volume control. This can be very useful in a home theater setup.The remote comes with setup codes for most common AV devices, including my Philips plasma TV, Sony VCR and Philips CD player, but no codes for my NAD reciever or OPPO DVD player. I used the learning function to program keys for the receiver's power, volume and mute, plus all the DVD player's main functions. The number of learning keys is limited to about 17-25 (it varies) -- more than enough for my needs, but be aware that learning keys are not unlimited. I had to do some fiddling because part of my equipment is not mainstream, but most people should find their devices are already in the remote's codebase.The greatest shortcoming is the almost useless auto-on feature, which activates the remote when you pick it up. It is so sensitive that merely walking around the room can trigger it, activating the lighted screen even when not in use. There seems to be no setting to reduce sensitivity, such as there is for brightness and screen on-time. The remote is shipped with this feature turned off, and even the instruction manual says it will greatly reduce battery life if activated -- leave it off.One minor nit to pick is the color of the lighted screen. Pictures of the Kameleon show bright white symbols on a deep blue background, this is actually just an overlay that comes in the blister back. The lighted keys are blue-green, and the unlighted background is closer to black in dim light. It's OK, it's just not as cool as the pictures.Other reviewers have complained about short battery life. I suspect the auto-on feature may be to blame for this, because with that feature turned off, I am still on the first set of batteries after two months of use.Pros:Easy to use, displays only those keys used by the selected deviceSound punch-throughVery flexible and versatileLarge codebase, plus learning keys and four macro keysCons:Overly sensitive auto-on featureMembrane keys instead of a true touch screenMore learning keys would be usefulThe Kameleon 6960 universal remote works well, replacing four remotes on my chair-side table. It does a good job of bridging the gap between simple multidevice remotes and those costing hundreds of dollars. For a street price of about $35, it gives me most of what I want in a universal. I would have given it five stars if the auto-on feature worked better. Overall, I like the Kameleon very much."",)"

"('I got this bag right after finishing school in Dec.  Since I graduated I do not need to take a bag with me as much as I did when I was a student, so I haven\'t used it a lot.  I read about people having trouble with their 15"" laptops not fitting, I wasn\'t worried about mine fitting cause I got a 12"" laptop, but I tried my parents 15"" Fujitsu to see how it fit.  Its a pretty thick computer.  It was very very tight.  Maybe it would stretch out the pocket a bit over time, but it was a real pain to get it in and out.  The tags on the bag do say fits MOST 15"" laptops.I came across this bag at Best Buy.  Before I saw it I had been planning on getting a Lowepro laptop and camera backpack, since I have one Lowepro camera backpack which I mostly like.  Problem with the Lowepro bags were that I couldn\'t find them in any stores to look at, and the two models I was looking at online were $150-190, and I didn\'t even really like them that much.  Also I don\'t need to take my camera gear with me all the time, only when taking trips.  Anyway, this bag looked well made and it was only around $50.  After spending some time online and in stores looking at bags while I waited for my computer to arrive I decided on this one.I had worried a little about how to pack all my camera gear if I have this bag when I travel, I didn\'t want to have to take this bag and a camera bag.  But as it turns out, the big compartment in this bag is big enough to hold the padded insert from my Lowepro Rover AW camera backpack.Pros:- Lots of pockets, lots of space.- Mesh pockets on the side are good for drinks.- Seems well made, but I haven\'t really put it to the test yet, and I haven\'t owned it long enough to see how it will hold up over time.- No waist belt. (some might consider that a con...)- Stands up by its self.- Compression straps (I think they\'re called) on the sides.Cons:- All my complaints seem to be in one compartment.  In one of the compartments on the front, which has slots for various small items, there are no pen slots.  I really like pen slots.  I put my pens and pencils in one of the wider pockets, but if the bag gets turned upside down they all fall out.- Same compartment: all the wider pockets are too narrow for anything I want to put in them, such as business card case, electronic dictionary, etc.  It could just be me that thinks they are too narrow, but I think other people will feel the same way.- Choice of colors.  I read on Amazon that the gray model is more like silver, so I got red.  I would have preferred all black.- Could use some more padding at the top of the computer compartment.These things I listed as cons are really minor though.  Just the things that could have made it an absolutely perfect bag.I am sure I will have more to say about this bag once I get to take it on a trip.UPDATE 3/11/08 - I have had the bag for about a year now.  Its held up well, but it doesn\'t see daily use.  I took it on one trip to Korea and Japan.  I like the big open pocket on the front of the bag.  Its good for holding things you want easy access to.  It looks like the bag is available in blue now.  Silver and red were the only choices when I bought it last year.  My other complains when I first wrote the review are still the same.  Also, the bag no longer stands up by its self as well as it did when it was new.  I still really like the bag.',)"
"(""Well, it has been a year since I recieved my Rebel XT and I am more than pleased with the camera. The build quality, features, and photo quality have made this camera a joy to own and use.When I first decided to move from film to digital, I began the long and tedious process of researching all the cameras on the market at the time. I had previously owned many Canon film cameras and compact digital cameras, so they were of course my first choice. I looked at Nikon, Olympus, Canon, and Konica(now Sony) dSLR's.The Canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time, such as price because of the Nikon D50, though the Rebel's other features clearly outway the Nikon. Overall, the Canon is just a superior camera, so hopefully, that saves you the trouble of spending nearly a month researching.Alright, so how is that camera? It is wonderful. It fits well in my hands and everything is where it should be. It does feel a little light, but it is made to be compact and light, plus that can easily be remidied by adding a battery grip. All of it's settings and features are virtually identical to the more expensive 20D, as is the image quality. There is a good amount of grain at ISO 1600, which is really a shame, but that can generally be fixed in an image editing program or by using a flash. The battery life is very good, but I do reccomend purchasing that battery grip that I mentioned before. Not only does it add weight and balance the camera, but it also doubles the battery life, which is good for those of us who go out and take thousands of pictures.This is just a wonderful camera for the prosumer crowd, and there is no reason that it cannot be used as a pro camera for creating prints and such. I would recomend this to anyone looking to break into photography or someone who has been photographing for 30 years.My recomendations:- Get a few extra batteries and a battery grip. Remember, you don't have to buy a Canon grip or batteries, and if you don't, you'll probably save at least 50%. Do some research on here. The Opteka grip is great, it is what I own, and you can find a huge number of batteries, just pick own with a good review.- Sigma lenses are generally in expensive, take great shots, and are durable. Some Canon lenses will have better optics, but will cost at least twice as much.- Get the Canon 50mm f/1.8. It is a very inexpensive lens(about $60 - $70) and takes amazing shots.- Big memory cards are amazing. Buy one, seriously. I have a 6GB card and shoot in RAW, so I get about 650 pictures. JPG will get 2000. I need another one because I shoot so much.- External hard drives are a must for all those big files. I have a 250GB Phantom Drive, and I reccomend that, but there are now many cheaper alternatives.- Don't forget a tripod and/or a monopod, a flash(though it does have one, external flashes are much better), and filters if you want to experiment.Hope you enjoy your camera as much as I have!"",)"

"(""Got this camera after considering between this and the 20D.  Was very impressed with the 20D, but the price difference could easily give me a very good lense, and the feature differences are minor, so Rebel XT it is.  I am a photography enthuiast who wishes he had the budget for a canon 1D MarkII but instead have the budget of a mortal and have to pay for a personal camera out of his own pocket.I have been reading some other reviews on this site and other sites regarding digital SLR cameras in general.  I had to admit, most of the reviewers really are better served with a point and shoot.  This is a SLR camera, it will take great pictures in automatic modes, but if you use your camera in those modes, get something like the Canon Pro1.  This camera is to be used in Av, Tv or Manual modes, maybe in Program in a pinch.  It requires you to understand WB, depth of fields, exposure metering as well as other wide array of nuances that come with a SLR camera.  If you don't want to spend some time to learn some details about photography, you will be better served with a point and shoot.  If you decide to use the attached flash for in door portrait shots, you're probably better served with a point and shoot.  If you need to frame your shot on the LCD, you're better served with a point and shoot (becasue the whole SLR concept of through the lense view of the scene, DOF checking, focus accuracy is completely lost by that opinion).  Yes the sensor on dSLR's will get dirty and require maintenance.  Some one mentioned why don't engineer design the sensor to have the opposite charge to rebel dust.  Well, dusts don't have one single polarity in their charges, so 50% of the dust will be attracted to the sensor doesn't matter what polarity the sensor is charged with.Also, this is not a Canon 1Ds either, so it does have its limitations, but then again, people who will feel completely limited by this camera should have gotten a Canon 1D series camera anyway.The best merit for this camera is foremost image quality.  It's extremely low in image noise all the way up to ISO 800.  ISO 1600 is completely usable if you stay below 8x10 enlargement and don't mind photoshopping your image a little.  Again, if you don't ever want to bother with photoshop adjustment of you pictures, you probably will be better served with a point and shoot.  The kit lense is of decent quality again for the price, but you're definitely short changing yourself if that's the only lense you decide for have for this camera.  If you want to buy the kit and had no intention to buy another lense, you shoud seriously be considering Canon Pro1, it's got a L glass and a good match between the lense and the body.  Buying this camera will be at most 50% of your investment if you truly want to make it worthwhile, the other 50% will be needed for buying good lenses (get the Canon 17-40mm USM L lense, the 70-200 4L zoom, and the 28-135mm as a walk-around, the Tamron 28-74 is an excellent medium range lense as well and is probably a superior substitue for the Canon 28-135 USM).I would have to say lack of spot metering does give the Nikon D70 an advantage, but this camera does have a center metering mode with exposure lock, so it is not really a show-stopper.  Compared to the D70, the Rebel XT has superior noise level performance.  This is from my personal experience as well as photos from a wide variety of sites on the net.  Low noise level is very important to me, so if this is on your priority list, you really can't go wrong with the Rebel XT at this price point.What I want to emphasize here is seriously consider your needs before buying this camera, to make this camera truly worth the money you spent, you need to spend a bit more of your money and a lot of more of your time on learning how to properly handle a piece of equipment like this.  Otherwise, you guessed it, Canon Pro1 is a very very good candidate."",)"
"('I should start by explaining that I have never liked Sennheiser headphones. Several radio stations where I worked as producer and announcer had various sets of Sennheisers, all of them on-the-ear types instead of around-the-ear, (which is the design that the RS 140\'s incorporates,) and they all were lifeless, annoying POS\'s.Sony 7506\'s are my favorite mid-priced phones, and I hoped that in some ways these RS 140\'s would come close. They DID!The sound is surprisingly full-range, with satisfying but not over-hyped bass, and smooth highs. I doubt if they go much above 12KHz but for TV listening and casual CD enjoyment they are very good.One side-benefit I didn\'t expect is the ability to keep track of a movie or TV show while raiding the icebox. Though there is some increased hiss when more than 3 walls away from the transmitter, it\'s still possible to hear the dialog. Very cool.I had bought these for late-night Home Theater use and for this purpose they have been about perfect.Pluses:-Hold a charge for many hours of use.-Recharge automatically on the stand.-Great noise rejection from nearby equipment such as CRT and amplifier transformers.-Comfortable for normal vertical wear, extended periods.-Get really loud if you want \'em to.-Nice, well-balanced response and relatively low noise floor.-3 selectable Channels for best reception or using different units in same house.-You can use normal rechargable ""AAA"" batteries when the originals wear out (Powerex Imedion recommended,) so no need for any propriatory replacement battery cells.Minuses:-Volume knob susceptible to unwanted changes by accidentally brushing against pillows (-a strip of blue painters tape will cure this).-The warning beeps that the transmitter is turning off are unnecessarily loud.-They are HUGE. They stick out like a Roger Ramjet helmet.-Not that comfortable to wear while laying on your side. (waa waaa, I know).All in all for the price this setup is a definite ""go"" and I\'ll wager most users will be very happy with these.Update: 10/13/2008, seven months later- Still running fine with no problems. A solid purchase.Update #2 04/04/2009 Over one year of use and still not a single problem, using them several times per week, ear cups are holding up well, sound quality is still much better than most typical sound systems. No new noise artifacts, built for the long haul!',)"
"(""----------------------BundlesNice headphones holder and 1/4, 1/8 mini-jack connection with installation manual.----------------------Design and Durability:they have a stylish and solid construction, long and thick wire and firm attached components, unbreakable easily with low weight. they can last long with you.----------------------Comfortability:Wearing these headphones doesn't hurt or bother you, especialy around your two ears but above arc in your head can cause a pressure in you head so you have to adjust it properly to fit in your head without causing too much pressure upon your head. And if for long wearing if you are not setting in cool room you will be bothered by these headphones because it made your head and ears hotter.--------------------------------------------Testing System:Platform  : PCAudio Device : Creative SoundBlaster X-Fi XtremeMusic----------------------Objective Quality :Frequency Response 16-24,000 Hz, THD &lt; 0.2% which is not that bad taking it from Average high quality listening. The rated impedance = 32 Ohm , the ideal power for portable players and computer sound cards with no need for external Amplifier, you can get an ample loudness of 110 db as good as you wish.----------------------Subjective Quality:High-Freq: Average flat high, the treble is not crisp to the high-freq fansMid-Freq : It play Mids pretty good for its classLow-Freq : Excellent Lows punch, that's the best you can find in these headphones----------------------Entertainment Fields:Music  : they play pop music pretty good and bass & drums' music outstandingly with nice and detailed stereo separation since it is connected to exceptional Audio card. On the other hand, Rock  and jazz music needs other headphones to handle these types clearly of music and also for classical or NewAge (Orchestral) music which is more demanding for wider sound stage and  imaging it is not suited for me since I listen to many NewAge genre.Movies : with nice stereo separation between Right & left Channels you'll be pleased with this headphone movie effects and vocals are handled good for its class in home entertainment.Gaming : As I mentioned, with nice stereo separation between Right & left Channels, the audio card SoundBlaster X-Fi XtremeMusic enabled a new technology for gaming which is CMSS-3D surround in headphone listening. You'll expect to reach to a good 3D surround around your head with different game titles: Battlefield2, Oblivion, F.E.A.R & Prince of Persia Warrior  Within - you'll be immersed inside the game atmosphere even better imaging and feeling of the rear sounds.Creation Monitoring:These are an Open headphones types which doesn't isolate you from background noise comparing it to professional headphones so monitoring with this is not appropriate.----------------------Verdict :They are good headphones with nice construction, comfort & quality and low Impedance make it possible to drive it ipod player.The diameter of holder jack plug is thick bothering users of PC in sound card out-jack and other line-in mic-jack.However, people who like the genre of music (especially pop music with a lot of bass) Where this headphone shines he will love this headphone and will gave it 5 out 5, but for those people who like Orchestral and a lot of treble music won't be satisfied for its price and must look for first for low rating reviews in order to gather much information about it rather than high rating reviews of users with different tastes & preferences to their types of music.----------------------"",)"
"(""I have had these headphonse now for around 6 months.  After using them extensively, I feel qualified to give a good, experienced review.  I use these nearly every night so as to not disturb my wife while I either watch a movie or play video games (which of course makes these headphones one of the best investments I have ever made, regardless of the rest of the review :)  I have been a long time audiophile, having recorded 3 studio music albums and being an avid movie and gaming fan. I will try to be practical in my review, so lets get down to the dirt.First, let's get it out of the way...the surround sound is a joke.  All it does is add a spaciousness that leaves the sound thin, tinny, and underwhelming.  Don't buy these for the surround.  Period.The sound is actually pretty nice.  It is crisp and clean while playing music, but during movies, action scenes tend to feel a little overdriven and lack the clarity that my Sony wired headphones have.  Honestly though, I really don't have any complaints with the sound quality and they perform as or better than I expected.  The only problem actually lies with hiss produced by the wireless transmission.The wireless aspect is mediocre.  As this is my first pair of wireless headphones, I don't have anything to compare it to, but compared to wired headphones...well, there is no comparison.  There is constantly a hiss in the background.  Turning up the input volume while lowering the headphone volume will allow you to minimize the hiss, but it is always there, and of course if you turn up the input volume too much, you get distortion.  Loud scenes or music will drown the hiss out, but during quiet scenes, the hiss is annoyingly present.  Reception is also mediocre.  I sit approximately 12 feet from the transmitter and I get intermittent static and at times I have to move my head around to get the reception to come in clearly (or as clearly as I can...hiss is always present).  The reception remains pretty much the same, whether I am 10 feet from the transmitter or on the other side of the house (which is actually pretty impressive that I can be on the other side of the house and listen to music with no real degredation in the signal.)  The auto seek function doesn't ever change the reception, so it is no help.The headphones themselves are quite bulky and a bit silly looking while on your head (which of course affects nothing in regards to performance, but you still do look silly when the UPS guy comes to the door).  All of the controls are on the rear of the headphones which for me causes a problem.  I have a high back couch and if I am slouching into it (which I always am) the cushions have a tendecy to rub on the volume pots and turn it up or down, which can be painful if the volume suddenly skyrockets to max.  This also occurs in my recliner where the back comes up above my head.  This is a small complaint, but nonetheless an important feature to be aware of before buying.All in all, this is a decent product although in retrospect I think I would have gone with a less expensive unit if I had been able to try these out first."",)"
"(""I recently decided it was time to retire my trusty (but antiquated) handheld GPS, and I replaced it with a Magellan eXplorist 500. I don't yet have the optional detailed mapping software, so this is a review of just the base unit and the included software. I should also mention that this review is based on firmware 5.1.61, the latest available as of May 2005. Future firmware releases may add more features, but I advise all gadget buyers not to rely on such updates. Buy your toys for what they do today, not what they might do tomorrow!Like most good GPS's these days, the eXplorist 500 includes basic street map data for the US and Canada. It probably won't include the street you live on, but it should have your freeways, highways, major surface streets, and points of interest such as airports. This basic map data takes up about half of the eXplorist's 16MB of built-in memory. The remaining memory can be used for your waypoints, routes, and tracks. If you happen to have Magellan's MapSend software, you can also download detailed street-level or topo maps. (But as I mentioned, I don't have this yet, so I can't review what it adds to the eXplorist 500.)The approximately 8MB of free memory in the eXplorist 500 will hold a huge amount of waypoints, routes, and tracks. If all you care about is simple waypoint storage and navigation, you won't need anything else. However, the available memory is pretty meager for adding detailed map data. Don't panic, though: you can add a standard, inexpensive Secure Digital card to your eXplorist 500. No proprietary memory cards to worry about!You can even attach the eXplorist to your computer's USB port and browse the built-in memory and SD card just like a USB storage device. This is very nice, though I should mention that you need to install a driver to connect to the unit, and you must use the included charge/USB cable. This strange cable actually screws on to the GPS--the eXplorist is water-resistant, so they could not put standard mini USB or power ports on it.On to the physical features... The first thing you notice is the size. The eXplorist 500 is small, though thicker than you might expect. That's OK though, it fits your hand well, and it holds a battery with a claimed 17 hour life. My own informal test got me about 15 hours with the backlight on minimum, which I'd call close enough.The next thing you notice is the screen. I haven't found the actual pixel dimensions listed in any of the specs; I would estimate it at 240x320. Whatever the value is, it is adequate. The screen is very bright and sharp, though limited to 16 colors. Compare that figure to a PDA and it sounds bad, but in practice I have found that it's enough to present a clear and readable map, which is what counts. You aren't looking at photos on this thing.The controls are a joystick with built-in button, a surrounding array of 7 smaller buttons, and power and lighting controls on the sides. The buttons feel sturdy and work fine--they are all you could ask for.The GPS receiver is definitely a cut above the one I bought a few years ago. It can pick up a signal in my house, where my older GPS could not. Thick trees can still confuse it though, but I'd expect that from any GPS.As for the software: the first thing I'll comment on is the speed of map scrolling and redraw. I'll call it adequate, but not impressive. The map display itself is pretty standard, though highly legible. As you'd expect, you can move the cursor around to select points of interest or create waypoints.The map can be full screen, or you can display two data fields with it: choose from bearing, distance to next waypoint, speed, heading, ETA, time to next waypoint, time to end of route, off course warning, direction, elevation, time, date, accuracy, average speed, and maximum speed. (The off course and destination events have an optional audible alarm.)Besides the map, you have a fairly ordinary GPS status screen, trip computer (no customizable data fields), and bearing display (with 2 customizable fields, same as the map).The included software provides for only the most basic data management. You can move waypoints, tracks, and routes in or out of the GPS. If you have some detailed map data, perhaps from a web purchase, you can add that to the unit too. (I presume that if you purchase Magellan MapSend software, it will have its own interface for adding a chunk of map data to the unit, or creating waypoints and routes.)Magellan has also included GPS features and desktop software specifically for those interested in geocaching. The bottom line is that these features are useful, but could use improvement.The desktop component, Magellan Geocache Manager, lets you open .GPX, .LOC and .GEO files and load them into your eXplorist 500. Geocaching.com lets you download cache coordinates as .LOC files, so this is an easy way to get geocaches into your eXplorist's memory. This software is serviceable, but it could be better, especially when you have multiple .LOC files to import.On the eXplorist, geocaches are filed in their own points of interest category, so you can choose not to display them. There is a special info screen for caches, showing data from the .LOC file: cache ID, owner, type, location, date placed, date last found, difficulty, hint, and terrain. (Note that the free .LOC downloads from geocaching.com do not contain all of this information. You need to be a paid member there to get more than just the basic data on a cache.) This information is nice to have, but long text runs off the right side of the screen, an unfortunate bug.Hopefully future software updates will improve the geocaching features, but this is a good start. Overall the eXplorist 500 is a very nice unit, with the battery life and bright screen continuing to be impressive."",)"

"('This is my shortest review.  It works as described with no problems.',)"
"(""This little device is adorable and has good feel in the hand, and I was satisfied with the sound it makes if it's just sitting there on a desk or table. However, I bought it hoping that I could carry it in an open-top bike handlebar bag and listen to it while commuting, but it's not quite loud enough for that.Further, I found the radio reception terrible! It has an automatic scanner, but it could not find a single station in the middle of the San Fernando Valley, which is not exactly a place lacking in signals. Interface-wise, trying to enter a station manually meant clicking a tiny button progressively through every .1 increase in channel numbers -- holding down the button would not automatically progress through them as expected -- so it's a real pain to reach high-numbered channels. And when you do, the PSS110 is not likely to receive them.My experience with moving files to it was an exercise in patience. It took more than 20 minutes to clear the machine and download a new set of files to it (4 hours music). That's just way too long. The small 256 MB size really wasn't ideal either, but might suffice if it didn't take so long to clean and refill with new files.Of course I knew this machine was meant for Windows only, but it does run via a SQLite database. Theoretically it ought to be possible to find a Macintosh client to edit the playlist, but several hours of hacking around resulted in no progress on that front. It still might be possible, but otherwise you must use the provided software to manage its playlist. You can drag and drop files into it, but it won't see them for playback.One final but annoying characteristic: the machine offers a way to randomize playback, however when powered off it forgets that setting, which necessitates navigating a couple menu choices down and around in order to re-set the playback preference every time it's used.If Philips creates a new model that remembers the playback setting, has greater capacity and file transfer speed, allows non-proprietary access to its playlist, receives radio signals as advertised, and has a bit more volume, I'll buy it. This one was returned for a refund."",)"
"(""The SD300 is extremely cool. It is very miniature, looks cool, feels sturdy and heavy in your hand with its stainless-steel case and metal buttons. It looks and feels durable as well. I perceive this camera as a piece of techno-jewelry from the aesthetical point of view - I am tempted to keep this camera just based on its looks and miniature size alone.The camera has a retractable lens that extends and has a lens cover that opens when the camera is powered on. When the camera is powered off, the lens retracts and the lens cover closes.The camera has an on/off button on the top deck as well as a zoom rocker, large shutter release button. The bottom of the camera has a metal threaded tripod mount and a battery and SD card compartment lid. The rear houses a bright 2-inch LCD monitor, an optical zooming viewfinder, control buttons and a cool-looking menu control metal disk with a select button in the middle.There is also a sliding switch between review, movie and still picture taking modes. This sliding switch has very well-calibrated effort - not too flimsy yet not too stiff, unlike the previous Digital Elphs, which had very stiff controls. The side has a metal cover, underneath which you can find a USB jack, A/V jack and a DC power input jack.Just as SD400, the SD300 is incredibly easy to use. I have not read the manual (I have not even opened it), but was able to use the camera and all its features in no time. The camera can be used by any member of the family and by photographers of all levels of expertise from novices to advanced ones (albeit it will not give you much control over the shutter speed or aperture).The SD300 comes pre-set to Auto mode. You do not have to do anything other than point and shoot - the camera takes care of the rest. The camera uses 9-area intelligent autofocus. You press the shutter release button halfway to make camera focus and the camera shows you (on the LCD screen) where it focused by displaying one or more green rectangles. Then you take the picture by pressing the shutter release button all the way.If you want more control, you can select Manual mode, which is not a real manual mode where you would be able to select the shutter speed and aperture, but rather a mode in which you get access to selection of several parameters. In Manual mode, you can set the ISO (50-400), white balance (several presets and custom), use exposure compensation to make pictures darker or brighter, use picture effects, color replacement effects, etc.The camera gives you instant access to the flash mode selection (flash off, red-eye reduction, night portrait, auto flash), macro or landscape mode as well as drive mode (single frame, timer or burst/continuous shooting) at a push of a button.The camera uses the latest version of Canon DiG!C processor - DIGIC II. It is the same processor used in larger Canon digital SLR cameras and it gives this Digital Elph amazing speed. The camera takes less than a second to power itself on in review mode and only about a second to power on and extend its lens in shooting mode. It feels instantaneous.The SD300 can capture images at about 2-2.4 per second in burst mode (I used Kingston Elite Pro SD memory card). In single-frame mode, the camera could snap pictures as fast as I could push the shutter release button (1-1.2 seconds per picture). The focusing takes less than a second (in bright light or in dark environments) and the shutter lag, when pre-focused, is almost unnoticeable. The focusing is slightly slower at telephoto, but still under a second.The zooming from wide angle to telephoto (or back) takes less than two seconds and is responsive, but has less steps than I would like.According to Canon, the camera can take about 140 pictures on one charge of its miniature battery (400 with LCD off). I have not validated this claim, but I took more than 60 pictures and 8 minutes of video and the low battery warning has not appeared yet (the camera has no real battery status indicator).The flash is rather bright for its size. It has an effective red-eye reduction mode and is sufficient at up to 10-12 feet away. It has a recycle time of about 7-10 seconds.The camera produces excellent photo with well-exposed, sharp, contrasty and richly-colored images (see the samples). The sample photo can be seen at[...](you can copy and paste the above address into your browser's address area)The skin colors are true to life and pleasing. The photos taken with the SD300 are sharp from corner to corner with only the very edges of the frame being slightly softer than the center. This will not be noticeable in printed pictures however since corners normally don't make it to the print due to the aspect ratio difference and other factors. Plus, the blurriness is so small, you have to enlarge the image to 100% on the computer screen to notice it.Usually, the smaller the camera and the higher the optical zoom it can provide, the softer the image becomes, especially at the corners of the frame as it is difficult to produce compact optics with high zoom levels. Surprisingly, the lens on the SD300 is so good, there is only a small amount of blurring in corners. Overall, the lens produces sharp results at all zoom levels and has impressive 3x optical zoom range.The image noise is absent at ISO 50 and cannot be found even in the shadows. It appears (slightly) at the ISO 100 in the shadows, gets more pronounced at ISO 200 and gets worse at ISO 400. Still, if you are printing 6x4 or 5x7 pictures, the noise should not be visible at all and will only be slightly visible at ISO 400 with larger prints. With 4-megapixel shots it produces, you can print your photos at up to 11x14 inches with good detail (ISO 50-200).Recommendation: I highly recommend Canon SD300 if you want a miniature, cool yet capable camera with 4-megapixels that produces excellent photos with print sizes of up 11x14 inches. It is extremely fast, easy to use and, dear I repeat it again, simply cool.If you want more control, you might want to check out slightly larger Canon PowerShot A520."",)"
"('These binocs are perfect for anybody who is interested in all creatures, not just birds.  We used them at the Everglades and were equally pleased with the views of birds, alligators, crabs, insects, etc.  They have gotten me interested in butterflying, and for this purpose they are superb.  I expect that in time, you will see rave reviews on butterfly websites.  Being able to focus to 20 inches or so allows me to watch insects & spiders with as much detail as if my eye were just a couple inches from the object (if the naked eye could focus that close).  The view is gorgeous.  At close range, it is somewhat like looking through a dissecting microscope.  Amazingly, the quality of the image is very good (for both near & far objects).  I tried some truly bad binoculars ($100 cheapies, zoom binocs, etc.) while shopping around and the Papilio is definitely at a much higher level of quality.  To me, the quality is not noticeably different from that of the $350 birding binoculars (8x32, etc.) that I have tried.  Perhaps a trained eye could find a difference, but I don\'t notice any.  A potential concern with close-focusing binocs might be eyestrain, but the Papilio is very easy on the eyes even at close range.  I have been using these binocs intensively for three weeks, and I am still delighted with them.  I was also concerned about the small (21 mm) objectives, but I have not found the image to be noticeably dark.Basically, these binocs are a real treat to own and well worth the price.  I hope that Pentax (and hopefully other companies) continue this line of product development.  If an image-stabilized version of the 8.5x21 came out for $400, I think I would buy it and just keep the other pair around as a spare.  Hand-shake is not especially an issue with these binocs (compared to any pair with 8-9 power), but with the gorgeous views you will want to really run your eyes over all the details in the image, so a stabilizer seems like the next step.  Fortunately, there is a tripod hole.  Actually, you could use these for doing fine crafts, but only if you are least 5\'10"" or so (i.e. with long enough arms), and even then it would be awkward for long periods.  Hopefully they will come out with a model that focuses to a few inches; that would probably require a longer barrel so it would be less portable.  It would also be nice to increase the field of view if possible; it is pretty hard to follow a flying insect with these.  If you specialize in birding, you may object to the field of view and the smallish objectives.Anyway, for general nature study, the only real complaint I can make about the Papilio is that, because of the special mechanism that slides the objectives closer together for close-focus, there is a protective sheet of glass right near the end to keep grit out of the mechanism.  I am concerned about getting fingerprints on it or hitting it on something.  The glass doesn\'t look very thick so I assume it\'s more breakable than objective lenses would be.  The case is OK, but it is too much trouble to keep pulling them out every time a bird or butterfly shows up.  Anyway, at this price, I wouldn\'t feel too bad just buying a new pair every few years if I should break this pair.  In fact, at only around $150, they\'re cheap enough that you might want to order one even if you haven\'t had a chance to try one out in a store.  Since close-focusing is the special feature, I recommend the 8.5 x 21 to get the big views of insects that you want.  I haven\'t tried the 6.5 x 21 but I imagine it has a bigger field of view and is better for hand-shake.',)"
"(""All the reviews about this product is spot on, this Binocular is perfect for everyday use. It didn't stress my eyes at all after a long use, and you can see so far with so little effort.It feels solid and very light, but it function so perfectly it amazes me to hold it in my hands."",)"

"('well the last 4 weeks have been nothing short of a roller-coaster ride with this lens. The first sample that turned up on Amazon was good and gave me some great pictures until I started the dreaded pixel peeping with this lens. AF was considerably as fast as a Canon but was front focussing - test with focus charts too proved the same. Some sleepless nights since the lens had never come off my Canon t3i since I put the two together - the pictures were keepers (atleast most of them) but I could not live with a new lens with front focus issues. I called up Sigma NY and they were willing to fix the problem in 1-2 working days (minus shipping time back and forth) but I could not afford to send my only camera body across for more than a week. Amazon to the rescue - a call to customer service - bang without asking a question they send a replacement that reaches me in 1 day. I used both the lenses together but the one that was sent later seemed to be of the newer lot (serial number, construction - matter finish). Gingerly as I put on the lens and prayed and clicked some pictures and went testing again with focus charts. AF was spot on - and they alternately using both the lenses for a couple of days before shipping the ""defective"" lens back to Amazon, I came to the following conclusions:Pros:1. This lens has an Amazing DOF - very narrow. At 1.4 this should be the case anyway. Don\'t know why one reviewer put it as a negative trait.2. If you can focus properly (tripod helps at f1.4) - the center sharpness is amazing.3. Construction is solid - much better than Canon 50mm f1.4 coupled with 4 year Sigma warranty4. HSM pretty fast  - as good as Canon AF5. F1.4 means its great for low light conditions and pictures are pretty usable with some sharpening in PS come out great.6. VFM not cheap - till Canon has a 28/30 f1.4 - effective 50mm on APS-C sensors at a competing price - this is always going to be a better choice.7. Lastly great PQ - good contrast and great bokeh. Period.Cons:1. Poor QC for lenses/maybe the reason put out by Sigma does hold true wrt variation of AF on DSLR bodies not being standardized. Anyway their customer service folks have heard of this problem and have a fix for it. Only if there was a better solution than shipping the lens with body to Sigma.2. Can be difficult at f1.4 since DOF is narrow. This is both a pro and con - depends on the end user3. Cant find any for the last two mins - Sigma could have included a coupon for ice cream along with the lens. The packing and box was good. (its not a con).Pretty much to sum it up - its a good lens - great IQ and good contrast coupled with a VFM label means its always going to be a good seller. Can fall into the great category if Sigma can do something to address the focus issues. Overall a great buy for crop sensor cameras\' provided you get a good copy/get is calibrated.',)"

"(""I've owned both the VideoMic and the Rode SVM for over 4 years now. The fact that the VM is still around, and is actually popular and well-reviewed, amazes me. The reviewers who praise this mic must be using a different production batch than what I have.Let's start with the obvious - it's a MONO mic. Do you remember the days of mono? Are we in the 21st century, or back fiddling with the AM radio in Grandpa's '73 Dodge Dart? If you read the description carefully you will learn that, amazingly, yes it is early-70s mono and you can adjust your expectations accordingly. Unfortunately I missed this little factiod and was pretty shocked to learn of its mono-ness once I received it. Shortly thereafter, I purchased the SVM that, while sharing many of the videomic's weaknesses, at least gets us back into the current century with stereo.The main problems with this mic are twofold - first, the rubberband mount. The mounting system, while meant to isolate the mic from vibration, create their own noises every time the camera is moved (gently, mind you, not like being handled by a gorilla). It's a very annoying low frequency rumble that must be FIXED in post by the use of a high-pass filter. I guess if you always use a tripod, then this won't be an issue. But for those of us out there in rough conditions shooting documentaries, the mounting system noise is intolerable. Furthermore, those rubberbands eventually (after not too long, actually) wear out and break, and need to be replaced, sometimes at the most inconvenient moment.Next issue is the cardioid pickup pattern, or rather the lack thereof. This mic picks up far too much spurious sound from behind and the sides to be called a true shotgun or cardioid. This weakness is also the case with the SVM. Any small cough, or even whisper, from the camera operator is picked up almost as clearly as the dialog that is supposed to be the only thing heard, coming from in front of the camera.On the plus side, the deadcat does work very well to reduce wind rumble, on both this mic and the SVM. Let's see, trying to think of other positives.... none so far....As a comparison, I also have the Canon DM-100 mic that is built to pair perfectly with several Canon HD camcorders. To say the sound and quality of the Canon mic was in another league over the Rode's would be a huge understatement. No vibration/mounting noise/rumbling/random scary sounds like it's coming apart/etc. while moving the camera? Check. Great, clean pickup of the sound in front of the camera (and even stereo, to boot!) while rejecting the sounds from behind, as it's supposed to? Check. Good wind noise isolation without the need for purchasing a $40 accessory cover? Check. The only real shame is that this mic is only made to be used with certain Canon cams, I wish it could be used with all the camcorders I work with.So in summary, I have no vendetta against Rode. I don't work for the competition. I am simply someone who expects pro-level gear to work at pro level. And when it doesn't - and disappoints badly - I get upset that I wasted time and money to purchase this item. Honestly, the VM is so bad it's sat unused in my closet for over 2 years, and I was only reminded of it after shopping for a new mic recently. And I was amazed, incredulous - that not only was the VM still around (like a bad odor that you can't get out of an old couch), but it's the #1 seller! What a wonderful and strange world we live in.I just hope this review helps those who are considering purchasing one of these, or the SVM which is slightly less bad, to see all sides of its performance before making a purchase decision. At least with Amazon's fantastic return policy, if you don't like it as I didn't you will be able to send it back for something different."",)"

"('I first bought a Audio-Technica PRO24CM for my Canon Vixia HF R20 on the recommendation of my local camera store. While this might work well for some, I found that in all applications except for locking down the camera and mike on a tripod or putting the mic on a mic stand, the sound was filled with base rumble, picked up all extraneous noise and I was better off with the mic in the Vixia. So on returning to my local camera store I talked with another sales person who directed me to the more expensive but far less than the $200 mic I thought I would have to go to, but infinitely better Rode mic. My concern was the apparent flimsiness of the mounting arrangement. So first I tested the sound which is fantastic since this is a shotgun mike rather than an omni-directional one. It picks up the sound from where the camera is pointing and minimizes the other sounds surrounding the mike.  I want to use my Vixia to do walk through videos. The Audio-Technica had picked up every hand movement on the holding bracket necessary of the shoeless Vixia, every change of setting on the camera, each movement on the monopod I mount the whole lot to as well as the foot steps, swishing of clothing etc. This Rode mike minimizes all that plus it has both an on/off switch with a nice little light to let you know it is on as well as another setting further up that turns on a low frequency filter that filters out any low end rumble. What appears to be a flimsy mounting is actually the shock absorbing rubber shock absorbers that also minimize the impact and contact noise from traveling up to the mic. It sort of waves around as you move. So yes, this is a concern if you plan of being very active with the mic swinging from trees or jumping from rocks of white water rafting. Not the mike for you. But if you take care of it and don\'t bash it around, it seems fine. I can just lay my rig down on its back side and all rest comfortably on whatever surface I put it on. the cable is short and springy so when plugged into your camcorder, is does not come into contact with anything on my Vixia so does not add any sound of bumping. My biggest concern now is how to transport it. The box it comes in is bulky. Because of the ""bungie"" style shock absorber, it is a bit delicate for throwing into your equipment bag. Am considering finding a long, narrow Tupper Ware style box and some foam. Any ideas are more than welcome. But I would certainly recommend this product for a reasonably priced mike with good sound. I can even take it off the camcorder and hold it with an extension and it works for interviews or on a boom. Awkward to hold  but then I don\'t use it much for this purpose. A short piece of plumbing pipe foam insulation would make a good hand grip for it. Certainly would recommend to someone whose intended use is similar to my own.2013 Update: With my new Canon Rebel T4i, I found the mic picked up the focus motor noise with my older lenses with the mic mounted on the camera hot shoe. But I found with a few hot shoe adapters, the mic mounts nicely on a pole and will make a very serviceable ""boom"" mic. I use a retractable tent pole for this which saves a bundle.',)"

"('I usually stay away from reviewing items, but this one really has me frustrated.  The good news is when the writer works, it works great, but ... trying to finalize a DVD-R disk has become a total nightmare.This is the 2ND unit with the same problem, so I am convinced that it\'s a Toshiba design flaw.  I will begin at the top.I ordered this unit due to the excellent reviews I\'ve read here and I was really looking forward to transferring our VHS movies to DVD\'s.  As you know VHS tapes don\'t last too long without the picture quality going bad and the colors fading.  On the other hand DVD picture quality basically remains the same indefinitely, so it\'s the best reason for making the transfers.After receiving the initial unit, I read the manual and followed the step by step procedure on the setup. Being a little concerned about using the recommended disks based on the reviewers here, I called Toshiba to get their recommendations and also to find out if there are any other compatible disks in the market not stated in the manual.With this information in hand, I went out and purchased the RECOMMENDED Maxell DVD-R (50 disks), 3 DVD-RW disks 3 RAM disks.  My wife was so excited that she handed me a load of VHS tapes that she wanted transferred.The first copy operation went smoothly using the standard setup and I was even able to finalize it.  Beginners LUCK?When we went to play it on another DVD player, we wondered why we couldn\'t pull up a menu as you could with a puchased DVD movie. I\'m talking about the little thumbnails of chapters that you can jump forward to.  This disk didn\'t have that feature!Well it turns out that you need to go into the DVD writer setup procedure and change a setting so that the writer will create automatic chapters.  You can set it up for every 10, 15 or 20 minutes.That was a fairly easy process!  However this is when all the problems began.  After making a copy of another VHS tape, it WOULD NOT finalize.  We got a ""This Operation Terminated because of an error on the disk"" screen message.  And an error 14 message on the Toshiba DVD writer window.  Had to refer to the manual to get rid of this error 14 message because you couldn\'t do anything else while this was flashing.Having gotten rid of the error 14 message, I tried finalizing the disk a couple more times with NO luck, so I decided that the disk was bad.  That disk went into the garbage can!  A new blank DVD-R disk, another 2 hours of copying and @#x#@!Again it wouldn\'t finalize and the same error, same message appeared.  I couldn\'t have 2 BAD DISKS in a row could I?  So ... I tried it a 3rd time but this time even took out the automatic Chapter setup (which could be causing the problem) BUT ... Same results!  Now I had several COASTERS in hand, I was getting aggravated!I emailed AMAZON regarding the problem, and received a nice friendly response suggesting that I contact Toshiba help line first to try and solve the problem.  And if they\'re unable to help out to get back to Amazon.The Toshiba TECH support agent didn\'t have a clue of how to solve the problem,  so he contacted his TECH support TRAINER who suggested that I UNPLUG the machine for at least 1/2 hour.  He concluded that some component had locked up inside the DVD writer and this will reset the system back to it\'s initial default settings.After unplugging the DVD writer and waiting about an hour, I plugged it back in.  Of course I had to reset the clock and some of the setting that got changed but ... HOORAY, I WAS ABLE TO FINALIZE the last disk.  Unfortunately that enthusiasm was short lived because the very next dvd copy I made, I had the same problem.But hey ... I know how to make it FINALIZE!  Just unplug it again for another hour .. and again it worked.  The problem is this shouldn\'t be the normal procedure everytime one wants to make copies of VHS tapes and finalize it so that it will play on other DVD players.  Not only is it time consuming, but also NOT good for small electronic components due to the power surges that it creates.So I called Toshiba back and they suggested two things:  Send the unit to them and they will fix it or I could contact the original reseller. (Note that they didn\'t suggest a refund!).The very next morning I called Amazon and talked to a very helpful agent who without any further questions, sent me a replacement unit which I received within two days.  That\'s fast delivery considering that I live in Hawaii!  IMHO, That\'s great service .. but guess what? (Aaargh!)The replacement unit works EXACTLY like the first one.  I am NOT able to finalize a DVD-R after copying a VHS tape without getting the SAME error messages, and having to unplug the machine for an hour and doing the same thing.So I will be calling Amazon one more time to see about returning BOTH units and getting a refund OR purchasing a different DVD writer.BTW: I have never had a bad experience with Amazon agents.  They are all excellent and it\'s refreshing to know that one company focuses on EXCELLENT Customer Service.  Kudos for you Amazon and your agents!',)"

"(""This thing is absolutely amazing!!! I've owned it for almost half a year now; use it (or I should say abuse it) almost every day to the point when I make 10 various format DVD's/CD's one after another; and this little gadget has not given me a problem even once!  It just keeps on going!  Here is what I like about it:Setup - I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows XP SP2 on it, and once I plugged in this device into one of the USB ports on it, it was instantly recognized and installed.  I didn't have to do a thing.  Truly Plug and Play!Format Support - It supports everything from a regular CD-R to a Dual Layer DVD-R's and DVD-RW's.  I haven't had a single problem using any of the media that I've tried.Overall Functionality - This thing is fast and quiet.  When it starts, it's a bit noisy, but only for about 10 seconds or so.  Same thing at the end of the job - it makes a bit more noise as well.  But during the burning process, you wouldn't even know that it's doing something, that's how quiet it is.  Also, when plugged into USB 2.0 port, it is ridiculously fast!  Just as an example, it takes approximately 10 minutes to burn a full 4.7GB DVD (It does work with USB 1.1 connection, but I strongly recommend using it with 2.0 to take advantage of its' speed capabilities.  I had to get a PCMCIA USB 2.0 card adapter, since my laptop only had USB 1.1 ports.  It dramatically increased the burning speed - before that it took over an hour to burn one DVD).Features - It has both USB and Firewire IEEE 1394 connection ports!!!  Also, unlike other DVD writers on the market, this one is very well built, meaning that it looks and feels great.  It also comes with a nice software bundle, including Nero Express and BackItUp.Price - I got it for about $80 (after $10 rebate) from NewEgg.  Amazon used to sell it for just under $100.  I think TigerDirect carries it also for about $90.  In any case, it's only a $10-20 difference, and this product is worth much more in my opinion.  It's money well spent and I'm extremely happy with this purchase.Summary:I love it, I love it, I love it!!!  I strongly recommend it to anyone who's looking for an external DVD writer (especially if you are a laptop owner, like myself).  Excellent buy!"",)"
"(""Where I go to school we've been having a bit of a heat wave this March, super out of the ordinary, but its been 70+ degrees up here in Vermont. As with temperatures of this degree (so, during the summer and apparently now) my playstation 3's fans go CRAZY when playing certain games. For reference, after extensive testing, i've determined of my small library, the following happensGames that NEVER make the fans rev like crazy:Metal Gear Solid 4Just Cause 2Mass Effect 3Games that are Unknown or untested:GTA 4SkyrimGames that sometimes make them rev, if you've been playing for at least 3 hours consistently:Deus Ex Human RevolutionGames that ALWAYS make the fans go nuts after 15 minutes:Crysis 2Red Dead RedemptionSo, during the winter this isn't a problem, but when it gets warmer, my playstation goes nuts and I don't want to push the system like that. Goodness forbid the school I pay way too much for invests in A/C so we're not dying in heat waves, so the fan running in my window IS NOT enough to keep my system adequately cool with those two games. My solution? After reading tons of these review on how this helped with ps3 heat, I thought it would be this fan, but I was apparently wrong. The fan does little to nothing to help my situation. I have my ps3 in a well ventilated area in the room, no A/C (stupid school), and the fan running. The room is livable at this temp, but my ps3 going crazy like that is ridiculously annoying, worrying, and confusing (played Mass Effect 3 for 4 hours straight, multiplayer and single no reboots with ZERO fan noise, but god forbid when i slide red dead in there then WHIRRRRRRRRRRRR). Even with the playstation unplayed for hours or days, thus cool, if i try even red dead or crysis 2, the fans BLARE.I'm a bit dissapointed, I've tried multiple setups of the fan (on the back of the ps3 to draw out hot air, in the front to push more cool air in) but nothing seems to help. Comments on how to optimize are welcome, but I suppose this product is best suited for media cabinets, as opposed to hot dorm rooms."",)"
"(""This works like the original. I've got it for six months now and it performs like the Canon original. I highly recommend it."",)"
"(""Summary:The top two reviews with the most helpful votes have covered these binoculars so well, I will keep my review shorter and offer a different emphasis. These Canons were compared to the flagships from Leica, Swarovski, Zeiss, and Nikon. With the IS system turned off, the views were on par or just below the other four. With IS turned on, there was no comparison. IS is the real deal! Once you use it (and can deal with the weight), you can't go back.Background:Some months back, I took up amateur astronomy as a hobby. I was told by veterans to start with binoculars and then progress to a telescope. Now that I have more experience, you should buy both. They are different tools for stargazing much like a pickup truck and a compact sedan are great for different activities.In binoculars for astronomy, there are two camps: low power or high power magnification. Low power generally means 7x-10x and high power means 15x-30x. Aperture ranges from 35mm at a minimum up to 100mm - but anything larger than 42 or 50 mm gets very heavy to hold steady. So, a mount becomes necessary which kills the convenience factor. I'm in the low power camp for binoculars. I use them for sweeping the sky with a wide field of view and large exit pupils. I also think the biggest advantage over a telescopes is their portability, and how fast they are to use for a quick look. Thus, hand-held size and low power are key qualities. I prefer 10x over 7x because that extra magnification is very noticeable, but it still retains a good field of view.The comparison test:Since I'm a casual observer, I only knew important things like chromatic aberration (CA), contrast, sharpness, and brightness. I tested this pair with 5 other people who knew more about quality optics, and one person who knew nothing about them - 7 people total. In our group, we had the alpha brands (Nikon, Leica, Zeiss, and Swarovski) to use as a benchmark. They were the Swarovski 10x42 EL, Nikon 10x42 EDG, Leica 10x42 Ultravid HD, and the Zeiss Victory 10x42. To make it short, all four of these gave superb views with such crispness and clarity, we doubted that the Canons could live up to their level because the price difference was nearly $2,000. For more in-depth analysis, these models have many reviews on the Internet. They are the best to many people for a reason.When the group held the Canon, you could tell their bulky size and weight were a huge negative mark against them. That being said, only two people (particularly my uncle, an avid birder and a lover of Swarovskis) thought their image quality was the same as the benchmark pairs with the IS turned off. We then took turns looking at some stars with the IS turned on. Everyone else gasped.My uncle was in disbelief. No one could have predicted how important a still(er) image could be at 10x. Somehow, sharpness, colors, and details emerged that weren't there before in the benchmark pairs. Still, he gave the slightest edge to the Swarovskis because sweeping the binoculars with IS turned on introduced very tiny artificats. Nonetheless, if you swept the night sky with the IS turned off, locked onto a target, and then clicked the IS button on, the views became close to perfect. This inability to sweep the sky with IS on wasn't a big deal to me. Locking on objects and then clicking became second nature eventually. In the end, I only knew this as a casual observer: I couldn't hold the other pairs, which were considerably lighter, without the image bouncing around. With these, one button click solved the problem. My little sister, the neophyte of the group, agreed with me. She knew nothing about glass performance. Yet, she admitted the view of the Pleiades with IS on versus the others were incomparable.My uncle still preferred his Swarovskis because he had miraculously still hands so the IS wasn't important to him at these magnifications. In addition, because of his age, the weight of these binoculars was too much with his neck craned up at the constellations. Everyone else younger than him could hold these just fine, and they gave the Canons the highest score.Canon 10x42 vs the 15x50/18x50:Before I decided to keep these, I also acquired the Canon 15x50 and 18x50 IS binoculars. The extra magnification was lovely, however, I still preferred the 10x42. Here's why: the L lens gave brighter, sharper, and extremely color-accurate views versus the non L lens glass. Even more, the field of view was greater in these (a big reason why I bought binoculars for astronomy in the first place). The exit pupil was larger too which my eyes can take advantage of in darkness. Lastly, the IS system worked better for the 10x (the shakes were more noticeable in the higher powered models); and these were much lighter than the 15x and 18x in spite of their waterproofing (which the others lack). I may have bought the 15x were it not for my telescope and my need to use the 10x for terrestrial purposes and at football games. Strangely, I did not notice much of a difference with the extra 8mm of aperture. I think the better IS in the 10x42 cancelled out this advantage.Miscellaneous:Everyone has complained about the objective lens caps. I bought two B+W 52mm clear filters (007M) as added protection and the supplied caps click and stay on these filters much better than without them. The added plus is that it's easier to clean the binoculars. In case you mess up, you haven't scratched the costly lenses. I also love that you can dunk these in a bucket of water for better cleaning.Conclusion:The optics with the L lenses place these in the same category as the benchmarks. With the IS turned on, they are the best 10x despite them being much cheaper. Were it not for their weight and bulkiness, I'm sure these would be more popular. Also, Canon's support is subpar versus Swarovski and company. Binoculars are a very small segment of their business. Therefore, if something were to go wrong with the IS system, the repairs would be costly. This likely scares birders who are used to owning their quality binoculars for decades.I don't expect these to last as long as Leicas. If the IS becomes defective after the 3-year warranty expires, I still have very high quality, although heavy, binoculars. Since I can handle the weight and their ergonomics, the L lens and the IS combined make these a keeper for me. A low-power astronomy binocular fan that does not have still hands cannot buy a better 10x stargazing instrument than these pair."",)"
"('.NOTE:  Although VINE VOICE is written by my name, I purchased these binocs at full price, long before VINE was started by Amazon.Seems very expensive for a pair of binocs, but the price is clearly justified as Canon has supplied some amazing optical wizardry in a small compact package.  I will outline what makes these particular binocs so unique....Before you read too much about these specific binocs, u might want to go down further in this review, where I explain what factors make the best binocs for your needs. (day/night, age, strength, tripod, etc)Details on these Canon 10x42L binocs:1. TFOV - 6.5 Degrees.  TFOV = True Field of View - in visual optics, TFOV defines how much of the scene (subject) is visible inside the image circles you view through the EP\'s.  (EyePieces).  The greater the TFOV is, the easier to locate subjects you are seeking, as you are viewing more of the subject area. (such as finding wildlife that appears in the periphery of the image circle)  To be specific, the 6.5 degrees means, if you stood in the middle of a circle, and pointed the binocs to the circles circumference, you could see a 6.5 deg. ""slice of the pie"".  It doesn\'t seem like much, because we can see approx. 110 degrees with our two unaided eyes, but the binocs offer 10x magnification, which is why we see such a small piece of the pie.  But on a relative basis, for binoculars of this magnification, the 10x42L\'s TFOV is exceptional, which also is what makes them very nice astro binocs for stargazing, as TFOV allows you to pack more stars in the viewing image circle.Large TFOV is a function of the magnificaiton, but also the AFOV (explained below), and requires relatively short fl\'s EP\'s which must be well corrected for aberration / distortion, and also must contain large field stops in the EP\'s, (Eye Pieces).  Both of these optical characteristics are very difficult to design and build...this is true in all optics, not just binoculars.  6.5 deg. TFOV is one of the most generous TFOV\'s available in ANY binocs of this magnification (10x), even those costing several thousand dollars.  This is one of the features that differentiates lower priced binocs from higher priced binocs., as larger TFOV requires bigger,  more complex, and therefore heavier glass.2.  AFOV - 65 Degrees.  The ""Apparent Field of View"" is a clear and sharp 65 degrees.  AFOV defines the size of the image circles you see when looking through the binocs.  This means, at 65 degrees, your eye must swing 65 degrees, (+/- 32.5 deg.) left to right (or up n down) to see the entire image circle.  To put this in perspective, one unaided eye can see 90 deg. without swinging.  Lower cost binocs often have 40-50 deg AFOV, which gives you that ""looking through a tunnel"" feeling.AFOV is unrelated to the TFOV, which designates how much of the subject (slice of the pie) you see in the AFOV image circles.  AFOV and TFOV is what differentiates expensive optics from lower priced optics in the same class (such as 10x30, 10x40, etc) as large AFOV & TFOV requires expensive and complex glass elements.  The other major factor though, is optical image quality, as our eyes are sensitive (and appreciative) to both of these variables, as we always want to compare visual optics to our unaided vision as a reference.At 65 degrees, Canon is nearing the limits of AFOV, even in very high end astronomy gear.... and probably one of the largest AFOV\'s for any binocs I am aware of.  But Canon maintained the sharpness in the entire AFOV image circle, with virtually no distortion!  (a remarkable accomplishment in optics for this mid tier price range)  The larger the AFOV, the more life-like the view becomes as it fills your retina with imagery, avoiding the ""looking through a tunnel sensation"" which smaller AFOV\'s deliver.  As mentioned above, an unaided human eye can see 90 degrees.  So at 65 degrees, you are filling 2/3rds of your retina with imagery (retina = where the image is focused at the back of your eye) compared to unaided vision.  This produces a feeling of immersion (such as cinema screen vs. home tv), and this large AFOV really adds to the,  WOW factor.  This is the largest AFOV I have ever seen in a pair of binocs at ANY magnification.  This large AFOV is the first thing that will strike you when using these binocs.  Unless you venture into high end astronomy gear (costing many times these binoculars) it\'s hard to find find good optics with a AFOV this wide, AND, with sharpness right to the edges AND virtually NO distortion.  Once you compare these binocs side by side with others that have less AFOV, you don\'t need to understand the technical details once you experience it.3.  L Glass....  very sharp glass, with no false color and pinpoint sharpness, nearing true APO chromatic lenses.  This is very evident when viewing stars at night, the stars are pin point sharp, better than most astronomy binocs I have used.... and with the the wide TFOV and large AFOV, you feel like you are space walking while laying back on a lounge chair.  Of course, with only 42mm objectives, it helps to be in a very dark area.  If astro use is the primary intended use, then larger objective diameters are better suited.  50 - 70mm objectives are ideal, such as the 7x50\'s I mention below...or if you use a tripod, then max. objective diam becomes more desirable such as 15x80 or even 20x100.  So, these binocs make good astronomy binocs, but are not ideal...there is better options with bigger apertures for star gazing... it\'s just a nice add-on feature if your intended use is mostly daytime viewing.Those who use high end photographic lenses know how prized Canons ""L"" lenses are...hence why I was surprised to see ""L"" glass in these binocs.  L glass at this price point is relatively unheard of for Canon.4.  IS (Image Stabilization) - well, this has been beaten to death in many reviews.... but IS is the single biggest breakthrough since binocs were invented - ASSUMING you want to hand-hold at high magnification.  Otherwise, the IS feature is not as significant.  The IS in these 10x42\'s are superb...  the ""push once"" IS button is a nice feature, as you don\'t have to continuously hold down the button while viewing.  The IS has a motion sensor which senses when viewing is finished.  It will then shut down the IS, to save battery life - nice feature.  But other Canon binocs have IS, so it\'s not what sets the 10x42\'s apart from the other Canon IS binocs...  But if you hand-hold, and desire at least 10x or greater magnification, IS should be your single most desirable feature in binocs.  Remember though, hand holding for long periods of time can be hard on the arms based on your age and fitness level.  IS adds weight!5.  Aperture  (Objective lens Diam.) -  42mm obj. diam. at 10x magnification provides very bright views, specially during mid day, and good (but not great) at twilight.  They are also ""just"" large enough to use as astro binoculars...once you begin star gazing through these you will become interested in the night sky.  Buy a good binocular astronomy book and you will be amazed.  If they tried to go with larger objective lens diameters, the weight of the binocs would become unruly, creating arm fatigue even for the young and strong....while these binocs can already be too heavy for the elderly or frail user.  I feel Canon reached a good compromise at 42mm objectives.  My one complaint about the design.... A pair of UV filters are a good idea to protect the objectives as the elements are not recessed far enough behind the rubber front rims.  (one of the few shortcomings I have found with these binocs)  I have a pair of Fuji 10x70\'s, which the 70mm objectives, which allow almost 3x more light in....yet with the IS and pinpoint sharpness, I am quite amazed how these Canons perform considering their small objectives for astronomy binocs.  I am pretty sure Canon did not design these for astro binocs.  But night time viewing is very acceptable with the 42mm objectives, as they allow 2x the light vs. normal 30mm objectives,  and the added light is very apparent in added sharpness and contrast.6)  Exit Pupil diam....  The exit pupil diam of any visual optic, is the diameter of the circle of light that exits the eyepiece and funnels into (or on) the eye (specifically, the cornea).  This exit pupil diameter is measured at the ER (Eye Relief distance)  The diameter of the exit pupil is determined by objective lens diam. / magnification.  42/10 = 4.2mm wide.  The significance of this diameter is how it relates to the diameter opening of your eye pupil.  If the exit pupil diameter is larger than your eye pupil opening, it means several things....a)  some of the captured (and projected light) is being wasted, as its overflowing the bounds of your eye pupil opening.  This wasted light means, you are carrying heavier binocs than you need to, as the weight and size of binocs are a function of the front objective lens diam. and magnification.b)  However, this extra light, provides a useful benefit, as it allows some eye placement leeway, so you don\'t need to be ultra precise in setting the binocs IPD (Inter Pupilary Distance setting) and keeping the binocs dead still.  As when the exit pupil of light misses your eye pupil opening, you get that annoying ""black-out"" condition in your eye.  This happens very often when the exit pupil of the binocs equals your eye pupil diam., in the exact amount, i.e. no room for error.  Soon one eye pupil will miss the projected light circle, and you will get that annoying partial black out in one, or both eyes.  As we age, our day / night eye pupil diameters change radically, so binocs buying decision making process is VERY age sensitive, explained in detail below.c)  The larger exit pupil diam. also allows your eyes to swivel a bit inside the image circle without the black-out condition.  With these 10x42\'s, at 4.2mm exit pupil diam., assuming you set-up the binocs IPD adj. precisely to match your eye spacing (this marked by IPD distance in mm, so you can easily re-set), as well as the EP to cornea distance (by twisting the lens covers)  you have very little leeway to swivel (rotate) your eye inside the exit pupil diam., so this forces you to keep your eyes looking at the center of the image circles.  Therefore you must constantly move the binocs to keep the subject of interest centered in the image circle.  This can be quite annoying when watching a flock of birds or wildlife...vs. having a larger exit pupil diameter, where you eyes can swivel around a bit, without moving the binocs.... but, that luxury comes at a big price, you must carry larger objective lens binocs to gain this benefit.  IMO, this issues is often overlooked in selecting binocs.  If anyone compares larger exit pupil (vs. your eyes pupil diameter, explained below) side by side, everyone will enjoy the added leeway larger exit pupils offer.  Hence why it sometimes makes sense to go for a lower magnification binocs, as they offer larger exit pupil diameters at the same objective lens diameter, see formula above.  Subject matter is significant here as well.  If your subject matter is still, this becomes less of a factor.To further complicate this matter, our eye opening dilates based on the amount of light hitting the eye.  For mid day viewing, most human eyes are dilated down to 2-3mm opening, regardless of age.  However, as we age, our max.  eye pupil opening becomes smaller....this is very significant when selecting visual optics.  Next time you get an eye exam, ask your eye Doc, what the diam. of your dark adjusted pupil is.  (they measure this)  When we are young, our eye pupil will dilate open VERY wide at night.  But aging is very unfriendly to the eye in this regard.  Here is a table showing how our max. pupil size becomes smaller as we age...Age vs. Eye Pupil Diam. (Avg)Age... Day light pupil...Night light pupil (mm)20...(4.7)....(8.0)30...(4.3)....(7.0)40...(3.9)....(6.0)50...(3.5)....(5.0)60...(3.1)....(4.1)70...(2.7)....(3.2)80...(2.3)....(2.5)As an interesting side note....  this chart demonstrates how our night vision declines rapidly with age.  The relative light that can enter our pupils is based on the area of the pupil, which is a function of the pupil diameter, pi r^2.  If you wonder why your night vision is so poor vs. your younger years, here is why....vs. a 20 yr old, here is the light reduction we see at the same ages as above....at 30 yrs of age, we see 33% less light than a 20 yr old....  at,40 yrs,  -  44% less light50 yrs,  -  61% less light60 yrs,  -  74% less light70 yrs,  -  84% less light80 yrs,  -  90% less lightBack to binoculars.....The significance of this chart, is help determine how wide your eye pupils are at a given age, which helps you better select what size exit pupil diameter binocs are best suited for you.  Of course, u must consider whether you plan to use the binocs for day / night viewing, as this radically changes the demands on the binocs.  Night viewing often requires larger objective lenses for best viewing, till you get older, where it matters much less, as your eye pupil will simply not dilate wide enough to offer u any better views... so you are carrying heavier binocs than required.  It\'s obvious from the chart, binoc buying decisions vary tremendously based on your age.  Here is examples of two extremes....If you are 30, and use binocs at night,  you would benefit greatly by binocs that have exit pupil diameters to match your 7.0mm eye pupil opening.  Such candidates are, 7x50\'s (7.1mm), 10x70 (7mm), etc.  Unfortunately, no binocs are made to produce larger exit pupils, cause the market would be way to small, so you must keep your eyes centered, and move the binocs to keep the subject of interest centered to avoid black-out condition.  Anyway, these are VERY heavy binocs, some weighing in the 6 lbs range, but the views are spectacular if your eye pupil opening can accept such a large exit pupil, i.e. u are very YOUNG!On the other extreme, you are 80 and need to only accommodate your 2.5mm eye pupil diam.  for day or night time viewing.  Now, a tiny pair of binocs, 10x30 (3mm), 7x20 (3mm) will provide your eyes as much light as they can possibly absorb.  To gain a bit more eye placement leeway, it always makes sense to use slightly larger exit pupil diameter vs. your eye pupil diam, which means bigger objective lenses for a given magnification.  But sometimes weight and size take precedent.  This is where personal preference enters into the buying decision, then, travel, arm strength, magnification needs,  etc.  All these factors fine tunes your buying decision.  But bottom line, Younger people can benefit greatly by heavier binocs, vs. older users who gain NO benefits by the heaviest binocs... and all binocs become heavy in due time, unless u have them mounted on a tripod or monopod.But even during mid day viewing, a person 20 years of age would benefit greatly with objective lenses 2x the diam. at a given magnification vs. a person 80.  One of the reasons is, larger objective lenses produce sharper images due to less aperture diffraction.  If you double the objective diam, you double the sharpness within a given magnification.  Hence the huge selection binocular magnification and objective lens sizes.In general, larger objective lenses have many advantages (mainly for the magnification and for larger exit pupils for the young).... but, being offset by significant added size and weight, and of course PRICE.Anyway, the Canon 10x42\'s at 4.2mm exit pupils are in a sweet spot for DAYTIME viewing, as they almost fully fill the eye pupil of the 20 year old, and provide some eye placement leeway for the older aged person - hence the 10x42\'s size has a wide market appeal.7.  Retractable eye cups.  These assist in eye placement.  As these binocs are a ""one size fits all"", they have good Eye Releif (ER) of 16mm.  ER is the distance the center of your eye should be at.  The eyes center is approx. 12mm behind the cornea (eye lens).  This leaves about 4mm,  1/6th of an inch, between the cornea and the glass.  Eye glass wearers must move further back, reducing their capacity to rotate their eyes throughout the image circle, soon, vignetting occurs (image clipping)  16mm is on the low side of required ER for EG wearers.  But don\'t expect more from other makers, its too costly to design long ER visual optics.  For non EG wearers, it is difficult keeping your pupils at exactly 16mm from the glass.... so Canon allows the eye cups to twist inward / outward to accommodate the depth of your eye sockets.  When the rubber cups touch above your eyeball, (at about the eyelash)  it provides a great reference point to keep your eyes at the exact ER position to maximize the exit pupil placement onto your cornea.  It also assists in keeping the binocs still as it is touching your face.  Remember, you are trying to keep the small exit pupils of the binocs to remain affixed over your eye pupil opening, so keeping the binocs steady is important to prevent that awful ""black-out"" effect, when the exit pupil misses your eye pupil opening.  This is different than the image shaking due to the high magnification factor, which the IS (Image Stabilization) feature addresses.  For a ""one size fits all"" product,  this is a very well designed system to overcome the difficulty of maintaining proper eye placement positioning while viewing.The message above is.... binocs are highly personalized items...setting up all the variables, IPD adj, focus for each eye, and eye cup setting, is important to maximize the use of the binocs.  Giving the binocs to others, and having all the settings compromised really can be frustrating as u must constantly fine tune the settings for your use.  So consider this when with others...make them get their own pair  :-)If you are forced to wear corrective EG\'s due to astigmatisms (the binocs will correct for mismatched refractive errors with a diopter corrector on the right eye piece), AND you wear thick glasses AND have deep set eyes, then the 16mm Eye Releif will fall very short, as a result, the view will be vignetted and you will no longer be seeing all the image circle.  If this is the case for you, see below for other sweet spot binocs.  So why aren\'t all binocs designed with longer ER?  Actually, the 16mm on these binocs is considered generous... in gen. binocs are not friendly to EG wearers.8.  Diopter adjustment - to accommodate different refractive errors of the eyes, allowing many EG wearers to view without their EG\'s assuming they do NOT have astigmatisms. (which unfortunately, the user often will be forced to wear their corrective EG\'s).  You use the focus adjustment for one eye, then correct for the other eye with diopter adjustments.  The diopters are marked for easy recall when others use the binocs and change the diopter correction.9.  Rugged and waterproof.  The build quality seems superb.... binocs are very sensitive instruments, and the more expensive the binocs, the better the optics and mechanicals need to be protected against hard hits, otherwise, they can loose their collimation (lens element alignment).  Canon did a great job projecting these binocs, as well as making them water proof, another expensive feature in binocs.  The binocs also do not fog internally as their barrels are sealed.  Of course the external glass is always subject to fogging when the temp of the glass is below the dew point temp. of the area the binocs are exposed to.  So beware of letting the binocs get cold, then bringing them into a warm humid environment. (this applies to all camera lenses and binocs, not unique to these 10x42\'s)10.  Excellent collimation.  These binocs are very well collimated, which adds to the beauty of the view.  Each eye sees the same subjects within the image circle and requires no divergence or convergence at infinity.  This is a very labor intensive process to provide such accurate collimation, something not often found in lower priced binocs., and the difference can mean ""WOW"" type viewing, vs. ""these binocs give me a headache"" viewing.  My binocs were very well collimated, but since I never saw other 10x42\'s, not sure if mine were the lucky ones...so your mileage may vary... if you can test them for viewing comfort, as perfectly aligned binocs should be as comfortable as your natural unaided vision.If you buy these binocs, or any expensive binocs, first thing to confirm when you open the box, confirm the two sides are well collimated, if not, send them back, as its very difficult to collimate binocs and they will provide you with years of headaches / light headiness, dizziness, etc.!  A simple test to determine collimation, focus on single subject at infinity... preferably something that fills the center of the image circle only (such as a street lamp many miles away)....then blink your eyes simultaneously, so you see right view / left view / right view, etc.....  If the binocs are not well collimated, you will see the subject jumping between views, as the brain holds the previous image long enough (image persistence) to notice the difference in placement between the two eyes.  While perfect horizontal collimation is not required as the eyes can converge (move together in cross eyed mode) with no problems, the eyes have very little tolerance for divergence  (i.e. move apart, the opposite of cross-eyed, as only a lizard can do) AND our eyes have virtually NO tolerance for vertical divergence, (one eye up, the other eye down) which is what must occur if one side shows the subject higher / lower vs. the other other side.  Any of these collimation issues become very apparent when doing the blink test.  If any new binocs are out-of collimation on horizontal divergence OR Vertical divergence, they should be returned immediately, as this creates large amounts of visual and mental stress, making the viewing process very annoying, leading to headaches, light headiness, disorientation, etc.  (but the avg. person would never know why, they will think its their meds or a food additive, or MSG in the Chinese food they ate :-)With lower priced binocs, it pays to go to a store and test this out, so you can pick the sweetest pair in inventory, although the store manager may kick you out  :-)  Yet if a small bit of convergence exist, meaning the two subjects overlap a bit (inward), this is not so bad, as it adds a slight depth sensation for infinity subjects and rarely if ever provides any visual stress... cause its natural to cross our eyes a small bit when viewing close subjects,  (assuming its not extreme convergence which would be very noticeable with the blink test)  Remember, mental stress caused by collimation issues are a function of ""how long"" the optics are used, combined with, how poor the collimation is and your tolerance of this oddity which our brain is not conditioned to deal with.  If you use binocs for a long time, such as birders do, proper collimation is critical for long hours of viewing.11.  Matched fl\'s.  Canon seemed to pay a lot of attention to assuring the fl\'s of each optical train, for each eye, are matched in magnification... .this is another very high-end feature which is often not a concern in lower priced binocs, sometimes creating mis matched magnification in each eye, creating a condition called retinal rivalry, i.e. the brain is battling two different sized images, which creates mental stress.  Often these subtle differences creates eye strain as well.  If the problem is extreme, you can see this in the blink test....not likely noticeable in binocs of the 10x42\'s quality.  (at least not significant enough to detect with such a simple test)Achieving all these variables, add-up to great binocular vision.  Binocular vision is hard to simulate at magnification as a result of many of the issues I pointed out above.... the more variables that go wrong, the worst the experience will be.  Clearly these 10x42 binocs have very good QC.  Now keep in mind, I may have luckily received a good sample... unless I tested many of samples, I would not know for sure how good the QA is.  With Amazons liberal return policy, I felt safe gambling and testing them out.So now ya see why some binocs cost $50, and others $5k?  A lot of features, build, IS, and Quality Control issues.So overall, these binocs are superb.  And if a company other than Canon attempted to make such a fine optical instrument, they would probably cost 2x or 3x the price Canon is selling them for.  Yep, this is Canons ""claim to fame"" making high end optical products affordable... I am not saying $1350 binocs are affordable to everyone...but I am saying, it took a company like Canon to cram all these features in binocs at this price...so Kudos to Canon...Now, there is a few areas I would like to see improved...1.  front objectives dangerously exposed....I would have liked to have seen an extra 10mm of lens recess.  (see below for a fix)2.  Eye cups are a bit hard... a softer rubber would be nice3.  Lens caps poorly designed on front lenses and poor fit on the EP\'s....  surprising for Canon, but all things considered, you will probably overlook this.4.  IS button hard to find, hard to push.  It would be nice to hear a slight beep when they turn on/off.5.  The inter pupillary adjust is very stiff and cumbersome to grasp.6.  Focus could be a bit finer.... a bit coarse for high end optics - but sufficient.7.  Weight is heavy, but that is the price you pay for such superb optics and and large AFOV...there is a lot of glass in these binocs.  Reducing weight, would either reduce the optical quality or the housings ability to secure the collimation.  If you\'re a frail person, hand holding these binocs may not work for you, test, test, test.The one issue you should first decide when buying binocs is magnification requirements.  IMO, I feel 10x is a sweet spot in binocs....but often 7-8x is enough, and if the binoc are used in daylight, and you are not so keen on the best optics, a pair of the 7x or 8x IS binocs could suit your needs, and you might appreciate their smaller size and weight.  Not everyone can hold heavy binocs.  On the other end of the scale, the 15 and 18x binocs are quite a jump in magnification for hand held optics.  Be sure you need that extra magnification to justify the added weight and inherent less stable images....its much harder for the IS to hold 18x image still vs. a 10x image.  (about 1.8x harder :)  But if you view things from a great distance, this may be a very important factor.  At 15x +, I would consider a small 80mm or 90mm fast f ratio telescope with a Bino Viewer and tripod as a more suitable alternative.During day time viewing, often, the limiting factor how far one can see with any optical instrument is limited by atmospheric conditions, NOT magnification...hence again, why 10x is a sweet spot for binocs.  The obvious, and popular exception, is birding, where the subjects are relatively close AND small! Remember, at 10x, viewing a person at 100 yards, i.e. standing on the goal line, and you on the other goal line, this i is the unaided vision reference.  Now, use 10x binocs, and the person will appear the same size in the binocs as if you viewed the person from the 10 yard line. That is a lot of magnification!  When adding additional magnification, some of the features of the 10x42\'s would begin to fall-off... such as the TFOV is reduced to 3.7 degrees, (about half), and the image will loose about 1/3 of the brightness level.  The point is, buying binocs is a ""reverse engineered decision"".  First assess what you plan to use the binocs for, then find the binocs that best fit that application (distance, subject size, age, day/ night, handhold or tripod, etc)  If you have multiple uses, there often is NOT a ""one size fits all"", and two pair of binocs are required.One final subject I would like to mention regarding binocs in general.  The beauty of these binocs are their compact size, relatively large objectives, Canons ""L"" glass and of course IS.  If the price of these binocs are not in your budget... one can easily attain a very good pair of binocs for much less money, excluding IS, but yet still have great optics and big (even bigger objectives)  If your intended use can tolerate either a tripod or monopod to support the binocs.  You can save a lot of money and get a very nice pair of 10x - 15x  binocs with even better stabilization via tri / mono pod.  Nothing holds optics more still than a tripod, (beats high tech IS wizardry) and in most cases, even a monopod can match or beat ""IS"" performance.  Of course, this is more items to carry, so again, it depends on use.  If you view by your car, this is a non-issue.  Also if you use a monopod or tripod, you can also tolerate more weight and therefore gain bigger objective lenses.... a much desirable feature as it allows for larger exit pupils (see above) which makes binoculars much easier to use as you experience much less, or no black-out (vignetting) conditions when the exit pupil from the binoculars becomes mis aligned with your eye pupil... as explained above, this is very age sensitive issue.Oberwerk has a lot of good wide objective binocs that offer great views for the dollars.  Garrett Optical also has wonderful large apt. binocs.  For wide exit pupil binocs, the Fuji 10x70 are my favorite, producing massive 7mm exit pupils, but NO IS, and not L glass, so view is good, but not as crisp as the L glass in these Canons...and of course, only 50 deg AFOV, so much less immersive feeling.  Of course, if the tripod / monopod doesn\'t fit your using style, than nothing beats the ""IS"" feature when hand-holding binocs of 10x or greater magnification.  Birding, concerts, boating, etc., the IS feature is unbeatable.11/5/06 -  I have added two images above.  (not sure why Amazon removed these)  See Customer images below the pix on this page.  I have shown the binocs with added UV filters and lens hoods.  Considering how expensive these binocs are, and how exposed those front objectives are, I consider these 52mm threaded UV filters and 52mm threaded lens hood mandatory.  With this added protection, I don\'t have the need to use the poorly designed front lens caps anymore as now the objective lenses are fully protected.  Worst case scenario, I replace the UV filter if damage occurs, which is not a bad tradeoff vs. constantly taking the objective lens caps on/off.  Both the UV filters and the lens hoods I used are from B+W, but there is many less expensive brands to choose from.  The lens hoods also do a good job of reducing lens flare, as the objective lenses are very vulnerable to stray light as they are not sufficiently recessed.  This is the one shortcoming I was disappointed with, but it was easily correctable, albeit and extra $50 - $150 dollars based on the quality of the UV filters and lens hoods you select.  Considering these binocs are selling for 1/2 what they are really worth, this does not bother me.  But it does add to the overall cost of the binocs.Don\'t want to spend this much, on Binocs, and still want to hand-hold?then, another GREAT binoc size to consider is 7x50....  As mentioned, 10x42 is a real sweet spot for binocular optics.  However, this assumes mostly day time use when our eye pupils are dilated down to a very small diameter, usually 3 - 4mm, which sizes well the 4.2mm exit pupil diam. circle of light coming from the eye lens of 10x42 binocs.  AND, it also assumes your binocs have IS, or use a tripod / monopod or some means to hold the binocs still, because at 10x magnification, its very hard to keep the subject still, which can make the binoc. experience very annoying.The other great sweet spot of binoculars, IMO, if you want to hand-hold, and don\'t want the weight / cost of a good IS feature..... is 7x50.  Below is a Pro / Con list of 7x50 binocs vs. these Canon 10x42L\'s.... some people may find the 7x50\'s a better choice for several reasons....7x50\'s Pros (Non IS)1.  Much less expensive, even for the best 7x50\'s (excluding Leica and Zeiss)2.  Lighter weight, due to no IS, and often shorter overall focal length.  Overall, a bit smaller in size.3.  At 7x, if you have relatively sturdy hands, the view is acceptable without IS!  (Although, not quite as still as these 10x42L\'s with IS, but close enough)  For those who shak',)"
"('It is a Canon. What else is there to say.',)"
"(""UPDATE 02/21/2012:I have found that coupling this lens with an external flash like 430EXII bounced from a wall or ceiling properly, it produces just gorgeous portraits in low-light/night. The colors came out so vibrant and lively that i now only use this lens and the flash to capture portraits indoor at night. Outdoor/daytime, and its back to my 85mm whose creamy bokeh can't be touched by this lens.----------------I used the nifty fifty for 2 years before deciding i am comfortable with primes and want to upgrade to next level. I wanted to get a wider lens as 50mm gets tight on my crop-sensor and preferably get faster than the 1.8 - low light performance is addictive. Thus i decided to get the Sigma 30mm f1.4 - wider AND faster. That's another fantastic lens but after a while, i noticed i am missing the kind of portraits I was getting with 50mm - more tight/intimate kind. So i looked into getting a 50mm f1.4 but then came across the 100mm f2.8 MACRO. Thinking longer lens will provide better portrait shots, i got that. It does capture beautiful portraits outdoor and in bright light BUT being used to FAST primes, the f2.8 proved to be too slow for me to take blur-free shots of kids indoor hand-held. It also was a bit too long on crop-sensor. I then did more research and came across this 60mm MACRO f2.8. It sounded like its image quality is on par with 100mm and on my crop-sensor, will be more manageable. It will also double as a Macro lens. I exchanged my 100mm for this 60mm. It fares better than 100mm as far as hand-held operation goes, still f2.8 is too slow for available light/indoor w/o flash photography so not all of my shots came out blur-free. But I also learned techniques to get blur-free shots with slower lenses - i have to be careful and mindful of camera shake whereas it was a non-issue with f1.4 or f1.8 lenses. This lens does produce beautiful images (see my samples under MEJazz) but for the purpose of portraits, i feel i am not getting the bokeh at the same level as 50 1.8 - I am talking about the level of blurriness, not the QUALITY of it. Understandable, at 1.8 you'll have more blurred background than at 2.8. So I am seriously thinking about going back to nifty-fifty (heard bad things about 50 1.4 USM motor). But then I came across the 85mm 1.8. Its closer to 100mm AND is fast at f1.8 - that sounds like a perfect portrait lens on paper. I have ordered one and really hoping it would prove to be ultimate portrait lens for me. I will most likely keep the 60mm as a sharp / macro lens as i got a good deal on it. Oh and the ring-USM focus motor on these 60/100mm lenses is just fabulous - buttery smooth and so quiet! its a luxury i do want to have on at least one of my lens. My rating is for the overall lens image/build quality - not for suitability for my purpose (low-light, hand-held portraits). This would be a 5-star lens if it was at least f2.0 or has the IS."",)"

"('Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we\'d recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we\'re not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you\'re within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we\'ve used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We\'re actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I\'ll try to post again with the results.Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing ""the entire internal mechanism"" (I don\'t know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it\'s now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we\'ve been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I\'m going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It\'s still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won\'t. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn\'t had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We\'re still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.Here is my final update, which I wrote April 9, 2007:Well, it took a while for Panasonic to get back to me about this for the second time.  In my letter, I explained the situation and asked them either for a replacement machine (new or refurbished--just anything that would work!) or a refund.  They wrote back offering me a full refund of the original purchase price, which I accepted and was very glad to receive; the check arrived today.  So, even though this particular product is headed for the toxic waste disposal center in our town, Panasonic did the right thing, and I will continue to buy Panasonic products (especially since almost every piece of electronic equipment in our house other than computer-related stuff is Panasonic).  Although I would rather have had this DVD recorder work well for a long time, like the E55 continues to do, at least now I have the money to replace it.  Thank you, Panasonic!',)"
"('I went to the Apple Store to pick up the cute little HiFi that just came out after reading several positive reviews online (and okay, some negative ones.)  I went to the store just to give it a little listen and pick one up.After a few minutes of listening I went ""this is it?""Yes, it is adorable and the iPod sticks right in the top but frankly - the Apple speaker system is not really great sounding.I looked over to the back and sitting on the floor were two large Klipsch iFi speaker systems looking unwanted and ignored.  I had previously been locked on getting those and the marketing machine at Apple almost made me forget them.I peeked at the boxes and the prices were slashed from SRP.  Asked a sales rep and he said they were being discontinued but it was too bad since he had a pair and he LOVED them.  I asked him what he would buy and he said hands down - ""The iFi.""So... with alot of hesitation I took the chance.  And then almost broke my back trying to pick up the iFi box.  (Yes, they are solid solid speakers.)  Luckily the Apple Store is awesome and they wheeled them down to the dock so I could put them in my car (in a mall no doubt!)Anyway -- I got them home and started hooking them up.Okay -- so these things look like computer speakers.  Don\'t let that fool you.  Feel the weight of one of the satellites and you realize this is a nicely made speaker.  I have Logitech 5500 Digitals hooked to my PC so I have pretty much the best computer speakers out there.I think the iFi\'s are better.  Truly big sound from 3 speakers.  Great resonance.  Crisp at every level.  A subwoofer that is musical and not overly boomy or made to make up for the lacking of the other speakers (Bose.... yeah you know it.)I put them through the paces of everything on my iPod and everything sounds awesome.  The only thing not awesome is that i now feel like re-ripping all my music in Apple Lossless codec as I can now hear artifacts in some (not all) tracks.They are wall mountable and everything is well made.  The room I have them in has 20 foot ceilings and it fills it with large spacious sound.  I had the satellites 4 feet apart and moving them to 12 feet made a big difference.Downsides:  the remote is tiny and you can\'t tell what the buttons are very well, NO balance control, the volume wheel seems backwards and is very hard to turn, and lastly - it is real speaker wire so you have to screw the wires on the back.  No fancy plugs here.Another gripe is with Apple -- you don\'t get the cool new features on your iPod that you get with their own speaker (surprise surprise).  You also can\'t navigate the iPod menu with the remote only jump tracks.All in all though -- this is the best iPod speaker system out there.  Unless you have to have portability which was not an issue for me.  This is now my stereo system.And now I know why Apple wants to get the iFi\'s out of their store - next to these babies, the Apple HiFi sounds weak indeed.  Smart move, really.',)"
"('After seeing some examples of photos from this gem of camera paired with a substantial [...] and getting a good price on selling my D100, did I finally make the plunge to a professional level digital camera. I am a serious amateur and I have owned this camera for about three months and shot off nearly 2000 photos under a variety of conditions. The camera is used with an ED glass zoom Nikkor lens G 28-200 mm and a Nikon SB600 flash. And I could not be happier with my new toy, um . . . tool. The image quality is superb with its 12 MP CMOS sensor. The build of the camera is a very durable magnesium body with well placed and well made controls. You can change ISO, image size, autofocus settings, shift from autofocus to manual and a number of other setting right from the camera body. Potentially if I became familiar enough with these controls I could make the changes without ever taking my eye from the camera. Furthermore, the camera is environmentally sealed and meant to be used under a variety of demanding conditions though I do not recommend taking it or any other electronic device into the rain without adequate protection. The grip both horizontal and vertical felt secure in my hands. There is a vertical shutter button with dials on the body to alter shutter and aperture settings. There are locks to prevent inadvertant firing of the vertical shutter button and shifting of the auto sensor for focus and metering. Below the depth of field preview button there is an additional button to which you can aside a variety of functions. I have it set to spot metering. The camera body unlike other Nikons does not come with a pop up flash though it does have a hotshoe. There is an additional sensor for white balance over the pentaprism. For those taking sports the camera has a high speed crop mode which shoots off much faster pictures but at a reduced resolution of 8 MP. There are three selections of metering: spot, center and the new 3D Color Matrix Metering II all of which may be changed from the right side of the pentaprism. I\'ve found the Matrix Metering to be strikingly accurate with just a few times where the metering is fooled but this has been primarily where there have been extremes in lighting such as a night scene with a bright street light in the view. The auto white balance though not perfect has certainly been an improvement over that of the D100. You can also select your own white balance either from a grey card, a white card or even from ambient light. I have primarily use the autowhite balance. When I\'ve had to use autofocus mainly for my cute rocket powered niece, it has been quite fast and accurate. The camera uses an electric cable release. You need to remove a small screw top from the front portion of the camera on side opposite of the shutter. At the time of this review the Nikon brand release MC-30 are not in stock anywhere though I\'ve seen the fancier MC-36 available several places. A third party release such as one from Adorama is less expensive and seems to do the job. The camera performs very well at most of its ISO settings. The lowest is 100 and the highest which is the equivalent of 3200 called ""HI-2."" The noise up to HI-1 (1600) is actually not bad since it is more like film grain than true digital noise which is neither entirely random nor nearly as pleasing. For those adverse to noise, the camera has an excellent noise reduction system which eliminates nearly all noise up to about 400 to 800 ISO. I have not noted any banding my JPEG images. There are actually a ton of other features which I am not going to detail here. There are a few downsides to this camera. It is quite heavy and large. I\'d recommend that you go to your local camera store and hold the camera. Those with neck and back problems may find it too heavy and those with small to medium small sized hands may find it difficult to operate. Also due to its size you are going to attract attention so you\'ll need to be more vigilent. Because of the high resolution of the camera you need to have excellent technique mainly in holding the camera. The Matrix Metering is so usually right on that you will notice more of your photos will be far better exposed. Though ""correct"" exposure is a matter of artistic intent. You also need excellent glass on the camera. If know you will be using the cable release I would remove the small screw top from the camera body and leave it at home. It is screaming to get lost. Lastly, this camera is expensive and is not for the casual photographer as you will be paying for many features which you will never use. For a comprehensive listing for features I refer you to Thom Hogan, dpreview or Nikonians. For those ready to step up to a pro level camera then the versatile D2X will make be an excellent fit for all many types of photography.',)"
"('""Find alternative to Apple-provided earbuds"" sat on my to-do list for about three months. It was right up there with ""clean the garage"" and ""organize vacation photos from last six years,"" so it clearly was never going to happen. After my Apple earbuds died an early death (again) and an experience with a pair of dreadful Sony EX81LPs (shudder), finding a good pair of headphones became mandatory. I messed around with a pair of Sennheiser HD 595s, which were excellent, but definitely not practical or portable enough for everyday, small carry-on bag use. I ordered these E4Cs, even though I was extremely skeptical about them before I received them. I was perfectly happy with Apple\'s but for their propensity to last two months before the wires started to expose themselves.I LOVE these. The sounds is crisp, sharp, excellent. I hear music so much better than I ever have. They fit in my ears comfortably and all of the ear tips are satisfying (especially the ugly, yellow foam ones). I worried about an adjustment period, but I put `em in and was instantly enamored. No learning curve at all. The cord is designed to be worn over the tops of the ears, which is surprisingly comfortable and unobtrusive. I thought that a cord of five feet would be too long (Apple\'s is about 3\'), but it\'s not at all. The E4Cs are aesthetically pleasing and sturdy-feeling (not at all like Apple\'s...but it\'s unfair to keep comparing the free model to the $300 pair). Bass is a little lacking, but I don\'t want to whine. They soar during guitar-heavy rock music. I can\'t have a conversation with these in. That means I miss a lot of subway drama, for better or worse. After removing them, there\'s about a ten-minute period where the rest of the world sounds a little...off. A little murky. These aren\'t complaints, just observations.The real tests for me are wearing headphones on an airplane and sleeping with them in (I went to college in NYC\'s West Village where sleeping with something in my ears was a necessity and I have yet to give up the habit). The E4Cs pass both with flying colors; I can lie on my side with the E4Cs in and be totally comfortable. Since I spend way too much time in airplanes and airports, I\'ve been able to test these on multiple occasions. Without turning the volume all the way up, these drown out airplane noise impressively.I absolutely think these are worth the purchase price. My Apple-provided earbuds will never again see the light of day.',)"
"(""I've owned several multi format players over the years and this one sounds the best of all of them. It delivers sharp, crisp sounds without sounding tinny or like it's in a barrel. The bass boost works fine on my unit. If you can't tell a difference you might want to get your ears checked.I like it because it's small enough to fit on my desk comfortably and it can be carried easily. The handle lays down flat when you don't need it. The antenna folds away nicely under the handle when the radio isn't in use. The earphone jack is placed nicely on top and you don't have to go hunting for it. The power and the sleep buttons are conveniently placed side by side by themselves so you don't accidentally hit them and turn the player/radio off. All in all I like the placement of the buttons, someone put a lot of thought into the placement and use of the buttons when designing this nice little machine.The LCD display is easy to read, it has larger than average letters and numbers. If you didn't have instructions for this unit you can almost figure it out without them. It's very intuitive and user friendly.The remote is not too small or too large, and the buttons are a good size, not too small to press easily and not too close together. They're also very clearly labeled so you know which buttons control which functions.I still have plenty of cassette tapes left and they all sound very good on this unit. It doesn't hiss when playing them. CD's sound clear without any extraneous noises and the high/low range sounds good to my ears. If you want some piece of an audiophiles dream then go pay the price for it. I like listening to all kinds of music from Irish drinking songs to trance and it all sounds great to me on this little box.I haven't used any batteries yet, I bought mine for indoor use, to listen to my CD's and tapes.I give this unit five stars for:Good design set upSizeEase of use and functionsSound qualityPriceFollow up: December 23, 2006I'm still really enjoying my little machine. I really really like the repeat function. It also has a repeat shuffle function that shuffles the order of tracks around while it repeats and that's kinda neat. There's another function that's really great and that's the programmable track repeat. You can program it to repeat a particular track however many times you want. I tried several CD's on 'repeat all' and it kept playing the CD over and over again til I stopped it. Out of curiosity mostly I let the same CD run, all day long and half the night, just to see if it would do it. It did. I am still very pleased with this unit and its' performance and would buy it again.October 12, 2007My little machine is still going strong. I've had no problems with it whatsoever. All in all if it bit the dust today, I will have gotten my money's worth from it. I've used it to death. I've played CDs, and tapes, and listened to the radio, LOL. It's been going nonstop since I took it out of the box;)Edit August 15, 2008This little box is still going strong. There are those who said there's no repeat function.[...]My little box is still going strong. if it bit the dust tomorrow, I've gotten my money's worth, LOL. I've played this little box a countless number of hours. I'm still very pleased with the performance.Update December 16, 2009This box is still going strong:) Still plays CDs and the readio works great. The tape player still plays tapes as good as it did when I bought it. This little box has been one of the best investments I've made for playing music:)Update December 2013My little box is still working! Everything still functions."",)"

"(""After thoroughly going over the product reviews for both this modem and the SB6120; seeing the nearly equal split of trouble people were reporting with Comcast, I called Comcast before I ordered it.  I was having trouble with my owned, older DOCSIS 2 modem (a Toshiba PCX 2600) of nearly 8 years strong (intermittent signal drops), and figured it was time to upgrade anyway.Comcast (I'm in the 'burbs of Atlanta) came out because they were seeing the drops from their end, and in a surprisingly proactive effort, decided to not rule out the old modem right away.  Instead they worked out some very minor noise issues on the lines locally first, then found some more significant issues up the street and had to have a linesman tech come out.  Again, the one primary tech gave me his cell number to stay in touch with over the course of the next two days, came back out and after they felt they had done everything and liked what they were seeing, then they suggested replacing the modem.  The drops were much less than what they were, but still occurring.I ordered this modem, it arrived as expected and called Comcast to provision it.  Took about 15 minutes on the phone and it was online.  I get the same up/down speeds and ping I had with my old modem of 30d/4u mbps.  Overall I'm happy with the quality of the product.  It's a little grey, warm plastic box with pretty bright lights sitting in my equipment rack.  To those out there worried about the heat thing I read in the other reviews, this is a non-issue.  Mine runs cooler than a freshly poured cup of coffee being felt though a ceramic mug that hasn't quite heated up (does that make sense?).  In other words mine is barely warm to the touch, so I'm not sure why people are knocking it for that.In summary:  Atlanta Comcast users should have no problems with this modem, just make sure Comcast verifies your lines are clean and you should be good to go with it."",)"
"('As I watched the video on the Apple web site regarding the new iphone and its elegant simplicity, I could not help but ponder the last 3 months I have spent trying to understand how to use my new ICD-MX20 digital voice recorder. Several months before that I asked my secretary to review digital recorders and order me the best of the lot. She and our IS team came up with this recorder and I have come to dislike it intensely. I have no complaints about its operation. It is small, easily transported, has excellent acoustics, and seemingly will do many things. The problem is that it is a challenge to understand how to make the recorder do the simplest of tasks. For example, during the dictation of a document it is common to rethink a sentence after it is dictated and to rewind the dictating device to a specific point and redictate the section. In my mind this should be no more difficult pushing the rewind button and dictating over the text to be replaced. Sony, of course, thinks otherwise. In order to dictate over a segment it is necessary to activate a separate process. Let me read you the text in the instruction book to give you some idea of this process (and this is verbatim!).""You can add a recording to the message being played back.Notes*At a factory setting, you cannot add a recording not to erase the message by accidental operation. To add or overwrite a recording, set the ""Add/Over"" in the menu to ""Add REC"" or ""Overwrite"".* The added or overwritten portion of a message will be recording in the same recording mode (ST, STLP, SP, or LP) as the original message, regardless of the current recording mode setting. For more information see ""Troubleshooting"".How\'s this for clarity? A double negative in one sentence would appropriately be interpreted as it is possible to erase the message by accidental operation. Fortunately, I had a hunch that the writer (if one can describe this as writing) did not really mean the double negative. So I spent the next 10 minutes searching the menu for either the ""Add REC"" or ""Overwrite"". After pushing almost every choice in the menu I found the correct button. Once this was activated I was actually able to overwrite a section of a previous dictation. However, the only way that I have found to rewind is to go back to the beginning and listen to the entire dictation. That is not a problem if the dictation is 30-60 seconds (although even that is inefficient), but more commonly my dictations are extended 10-20 min documents. So I am still trying to figure out how to make the device go back a short distance.I would suggest that you not bother reading the instructions, but in fact it is virtually impossible to understand the thought processes of the people who designed the device without the instructions - there is no escaping the pain.This brings me to my major point. This device, while a wonder of technology, was designed by someone who was intent on torturing the user by creating an interface that is at best unfriendly. To continue the process of torture, he (this could only be a male) then convinced his best friend to write the instruction pamphlet for this device. I can only imagine the glee they must have experienced as they concocted the perfect way to drive the unsuspecting purchaser mad. Caveat emptor.',)"
"('Here are the basics that I considered and have found out from about 9 months of ownership. Keep in mind opinions on photography equipment varies greatly by the user and what the equipment is used for so while I think the 5D is near-perfect, others might not.While the positives and negatives seem even in number, the positives FAR outweigh the negatives. I have no regrets about my purchase.Positives+Full frame sensor: allows me to acheive true wide angle photographs with no crop factor+Image size: I have had a number of large (20""x30"") prints made and the results are flawless+Ability to shoot in RAW: While the files are huge (12MB+ each), the information and options this format provides has really expanded my technical and creative abilities.+Build quality: While I haven\'t tried the true Canon Pro series (1 series), the 5D is pleasantly sturdy and feels solid in my hands. I can see how some might find it too heavy, especially with an L series lens.Negatives--Lens requirements: Because of the full frame sensor, the 5D brings out the best (and worst) out of the corners and edges of your lenses. You will be able to tell a lesser quality lens more easily on the 5D than on a cropped sensor lens. The obvious negative is that better lenses like the L-series are generally much more expensive ($600+)-No flash: Not a big deal to me but I\'ve noticed that people are surprised when they see the 5D has no flash. This doesn\'t matter that much since built in flashes are rarely useful in most situations.-Dust in sensor: Make sure you get a good sensor cleaning kit shortly after getting the 5D. There are steps you can take to minimize dust like changing lenses rarely and always indoors but you will need to clean the sensor every few months depending on use. To test if you need to clean (on any DSLR), put the camera on a tripod or flat surface, point it at a white wall , focus, and shoot with a long exposure and small aperture (5+ seconds and f/16 or smaller). If there is any junk on your sensor you should see it.',)"
"('Amazing quality for the money!  I was shocked at how crisp the images are at 300mm!',)"
"('When my EOS 10D died a month ago I decided to buy the 60D and wanted a longer focal length and IS lens than the 28-200mm USM I\'ve used over the past 8 years.  I really wanted the EF 100-400mm L 4-5.6 IS USM but the $1600 price tag was a bit rich.  I\'d test driven both this lens and the 100-400 in the past and really thought I would be OK settling for this one.  I was wrong.  Not that this is a bad lens, far from it, it\'s a very good lens, especially considering the sub $500 price tag.  For the money it\'s great, it just didn\'t give me a whole lot more than the 28-200 I already owned nor the 400mm (640mm on the 60D) I desired.The Pros:  Great telephoto-zoom for under $500.  Good clarity in well-lit situations.  Lightweight. An excellent prosumer grade, 2nd lens if you\'re looking to add to the kit lens that comes with a your Rebel or D series.  The Image Stabilization works very well and allows you to shoot quick moving objects at reduced shutter speeds.  I shoot a lot of aviation photography and if you shoot fast shutter speeds on propeller aircraft, you end up ""stopping"" the propeller and it looks like the aircraft isn\'t moving.  With IS on in Mode 2m you get the nice full-motion propeller circle while freezing the detail of the aircraft\'s fuselage.Cons: Slow and noisy focus.  In lower light situations, even cloudy days, this lens\' shortcomings are magnified.  Things get grainy on cloudy days.  Even in bright sunlight I found myself pushing the brightness compensation in my 60D up a few notches to get acceptable results, even with the 60D\'s lens illumination compensation on.  I feel the 58mm barrel diameter just doesn\'t allow enough light in.  The construction is ABS which makes the lens light but not sturdy feeling.  I worry it wont absorb ""rugged use"".  Autofocus is slow, noticeably slower than my EF 28-200 USM (non IS).The bottom line:  I went to my credit union, borrowed the $1600 and purchased the 100-400 L and will be returning this one.  It is a GREAT 2nd lens but when I had the EF-S 18-135 IS which came with my camera & the 28-200 USM from my previous rig, this lens just didn\'t give me much more than I already had.',)"
"(""I debated a long time before buying this lens.  I already had the Canon 55-250 and was getting pretty good shots, however, I wanted more reach.  The 400L and 600L were way out of my pricerange so my options were stick with the 55-250 or get this lens.  I did a google search re comparing this lens with the 55-250 and got lots of threads on photo forums where this was discussed.  Most comments indicated if you already had the 55-250 it was foolish to spend $400 to get the additional 50 since you could gain the same by walking a few steps closer to your subject.But walking closer is not always an option.  I enjoy photographing kiteboarders and surfers in action and walking a few steps closer means being up to my waste in water.  Likewise shooting other types of sports action you can't walk onto the playing area in order to get closer to the subjects.So I bought this lens and am very glad I did.  Now the subjects come closer to filling the frame and the photos are clearer and sharper than those taken with my 55-250.Yesterday I had an experience that would have convinced me I made a wise decision if I had any doubts.  When shooting kiteboarders I normally shoot Tv at 1/1000 because they are moving so fast and I don't want blurring.  Yesterday the wind was very good and the kiteboarders were going airborne.  I had a field day and was certain I had lots of good shots.  Until just before leaving I noticed that I was in P and had been shooting at a slower speed.  I felt almost physically sick thinking about all the good shots that I'd messed up by forgetting to switch to Tv 1/1000.  Staying and taking more was not an option because the wind had died down and the best kiteboarders had come ashore.What a wonderful surprise to upload those photos to my computer and find that even though shot between 1/395 and 1/512, more than I would have expected based on my experience with the 55-250 were keepers.  1/1000 would have been better, but the photos were sharper than had I been shooting with the 55-250 and because I was shooting RAW and the blurring was minimal, I could correct for much of what there was in post processing.This lens is definitely sharper than my 55-250.  I have confirmed this many times over as I pull together photos of kiteboarders to make a kiteboard gallery.  The photos taken with both lenses are good, but those taken with this lens are a little sharper, a little clearer, and require less post processing.And the subjects fill more of the frame, the  desire for which was a major reason for buying the lens.I like to have a hood on my lenses to prevent possible flare, however, because this lens is long I decided against the plastic-type hood I have on other lenses.  Instead, I purchased a rubber lens that you can collapse.  It is not as deep as the plastic hood for this lens so doesn't make the lens appear excessively long when in use, and because it collapses it takes up less space in the camera bag.Finally, I'm using the lens on a Canon T2i, which is smaller than most of the other Canon SLRs.  However, I have a battery pack, which makes the camera larger and provides more places to hold it.  If it were not for the battery pack, I believe this lens would be difficult to manage on the T2i because of its length and weight; the weight is about the same as the camera without the battery pack.  It is noticeably longer and heavier than the 55-250, which is a better size for the camera without a battery pack.  So if you are thinking of using this lens on a T2i, I suggest you also consider getting a battery pack so that the lens is attached to a larger, heavier camera than is the case without the battery pack."",)"
"(""I love my little iPod Nano, which keeps me company on my too-frequent flights, in airports, while running or working out, on walks across town -- and now, thanks to a surprisingly good mini-speaker system I got for Christmas -- I even use it as a tiny stereo in my home office.It's not the perfect MP3 player, if such a thing is even possible. Some users criticize it for not having much memory compared to the larger iPods -- absolutely true. And there are complaints about it scratching easily -- again, true, though in my case they are very slight and certainly nothing that is distracting. At least one review complained that the earphone jack is at the bottom of the unit. Again, true, and it can be annoying (because of that, I must load the iPod upside down into the mini-speaker system), but it's necessary because the player's thin profile didn't allow enough space for both a screen and a headphone jack on top.But look at it! It's like a jewel -- delicate, balanced, beautiful. When I first got mine, I found myself staring at it for no reason at all. The sound is as round and powerful as from any previous iPod I've owned, and yet it's pretty and small enough that it makes my RAZR V3 mobile phone look like an old SUV when they're placed next to each other. And the Nano is so slim that on a recent trip I realized I had inadvertently started using it as a bookmark while trudging across a foreign airport rushing from one flight to another.But it's not for everyone, obviously. It won't hold your entire music collection. And although it will hold photos, the smallish screen will make actually studying the images of loved ones while far from them less enjoyable than it should be -- and forget photos of scenery, which just become a collection of colorful smudges, like a tiny Monet. But I still believe I still believe the Nano is a great victory of design and function, even by the standards of a company known for such triumphs.A few random thoughts:* The choice between the black and white Nano should be based purely on your personal taste, as the functionality and cost are exactly the same. But one thing to keep in mind is that with the black unit, the headphones are still white and that can seem aesthetically jarring if you notice that kind of thing.* Get the Nano from a vendor that will laser your name and some other information on the back. It's a cool feature.* I own the 2GB model, which I bought because the 4GB Nano was sold out at the time. I thought I would regret not buying the larger one, but I don't. Neither would allow me to just keep every song I own on it, and so I get into a mindset of transferring play lists that reflect my mood while the Nano recharging. Once you're accustomed to that, limiting yourself to either 500 or 1,000 songs isn't tough. I use my Nano all the time and am forever switching songs back and forth from iTunes, and yet I don't think it's ever been more than 2/3 full.* Battery life isn't great and it gets worse over time. But it also charges quickly. And if you have a phone that uses the small USB ports as I have you can buy an adaptor that actually allows you to (slowly, slowly) charge the iPod from the cel phone's battery -- something I've done a few times when I was more interested in listening to what Bob Dylan had to say than I was in whoever might call.* A suggestion to Apple's designers: since the unusual position of the headphone jack requires us to use the device upside down sometimes, why not include a menu feature that gives user the option to flip the screen, making it into an iPod with the jack on top and screen on the bottom?"",)"
"('My iMac bit the dust recently and while it\'s being repaired, I\'m having to use my iBook more than ever. The track pad is driving me nuts! On my iMac, I use the 4-button Kensington trackball, which I love...  but in the seating arrangement I have with the iBook, the Kensington was a bit too high in altitude from the screen and impractical.I am loving this little mouse... mostly that scroll ball, which is the coolest little scroller I\'ve ever used. To quote Linda Richman, ""it\'s like buttah!"" It is so velvety smooth and so well placed, it takes no wrist movement or strain to scroll the night away in any direction.Every other scroll wheel or ball I\'ve ever encountered is either an up/down or left/right scroller, never both - but this one does it all, even diagonal! This is very handy in iPhoto or even Excel.The mouse loses a star for the squeeze buttons on either side. This is obviously something that Apple has planned for a long time. The same scalloped button shapes were on all other mice for the past few years, just not functional. The squeeze buttons on the Mighty Mouse aren\'t that easy to use. The positioning is awkward because it takes a lot of force to squeeze which is practical for opening a jar, not for repetitive mouse movements. It\'s not something I\'m going to miss terribly, though... and I suppose it\'s a compromise so I don\'t engage the squeeze by accident.I made the switch from Windows in 1996, but I still find myself having to use that godforsaken platform from time to time and the one thing I do appreciate is the right-click... for this reason, I have never made use of the one-button mice that have come with my Macs over the years - I have a drawer full of them. I really didn\'t want to use a one-button mouse for my iBook, either... then I tried the Mighty Mouse and knew this was going to be my iBook mouse.I wish there was a keyboard toggle where the scroll ball could be turned into a trackball off and on, so I could track the cursor across the screen and then use it to scroll.I don\'t know what the lifespan of this gizmo is. It is a physical scrolling ball and while there is very little space for debris to get in there, you know that dust, tiny hairs and skin oils are going to collect in the mouse\'s innards - and it does not appear to be serviceable. Apple does include a 1 year limited warranty... so if it lasts one year, cost of ownership is just over 7 cents per day.The right-click is not set by default, and once set, takes some discipline regarding where your fingers are on the mouse.Apple seriously needs to come out with a bluetooth wireless version of this mouse, but for now, I\'m happy. Applause to Apple for making the mouse compatible with Wndows XP and 2000. While I try to avoid the Windows platform, sometimes you just can\'t escape. It\'s nice to know that the iPod isn\'t the only piece of Apple hardware I can use with Windows, or Virtual PC.',)"
"('After researching for a DVD recorder with hard drive for several weeks it became apparent that this new model coming out would be worth waiting for. I had almost settled on the E85HS model but after reading the reviews it seemed it had a lot of problems and was pretty limited to the types of disks it would record to. This new model has solved all that with several more types (read specs) to record to. The TV GUIDE downloaded just fine and works like a charm. I haven\'t recorded too much just yet (only have had it for a week) and have had no problems with it freezing up. The TV GUIDE editing works well and you need it as the stations on my system came in random order. I just rearranged them and turned off the channels that I didn\'t want. This device can certainly  replace TIVO that is for sure. Be sure to follow the intructions about giving it time to download the TV GUIDE stations. It needs to be left off (standby) for at least 24 hours. I had to play with it for the first day or two so it took me a little longer to get up and running. Also, the manual is a bit daunting but I found by playing around you could figure out most of the remote functions. As you can tell, I didn\'t get this machine to convert VCR tapes. I wanted something that could replace my converter box from my cable TV company (RCN) and have TIVO capabilities. This unit does that magnificently. I am now using my converter box upstairs with another tv so I can tune in music channels and use the ""on demand"" channel. However, this unit will work with the converter box with the included IR Blaster so it is a very versatile recorder and tuner box. I\'ll come back later and add addtional information about my recording and editing experience.7/7/05 update: I finally got around to editing and dubbing a TV recording to DVD. It was a very easy process overall. The only thing that slows you down is trying to read the instruction manual. Once you are on the editing screen (""Shorten Title"" as it is called) it is pretty intuitive and with a little trial and error it was a pretty fast operation. Now my son-in-law has a commercial free copy of the Eagles concert. One thing to remember is if you want to utilize high-speed dubbing you need to turn it on before you start. This means even before you start recording a program. Once it is recorded without high-speed dubbing you are stuck with a dubbing time equal to the length of your recording. Panasonic recommends that you set that option to off unless you know you want to dub a program at high speed. They don\'t say why. Even though this wasn\'t the primary reason to buy this recorder for me it really seems to do the job and would be great for converting VHS tapes to DVD. Finally, don\'t forget to finalize your DVD so it will play on other devices. There is a prompt for it so it really isn\'t a problem.As a follow up to my primary review, I am loving the recording of TV programs on the hard drive. I record and watch movies that I would never have bothered with because of the commercials. The TV GUIDE makes it very simple (push one button)to record. With the on screen menus you don\'t even need the book to use this function. The normal (SP) speed gives you 44 hours of recording time and I can\'t tell the difference between it and the orginal TV program in picture or sound quality.Overall, this device has exceeded all of my expectations.',)"
"('I agree with most of the things in the reviews, I will just address a few differences:1.- TV Guide works without a Cable Box (that\'s what I have and it worked fine, but it does take about 20 hrs to download and may require extra fiddling with it...mine told me there were 4 different downloads so please tell me which one is your cable company...after that I had to wait another 3-4 hrs) but after that it worked as advertised.  Organizing the channels in the order I want takes a while.  Check with your cable company if the TV guide thing is a must for you...it makes life easier, but you don\'t really need it if you know when your favourite TV shows play (use your computer and the internet ... not big deal)2.- It\'s a somewhat complex (compared with a toaster) machine, so obviously the manual es extensive...but if you finish Highschool and read carefully you should be able to figure it out...I don\'t understand the reviewers that complained about it...yes the manual could be better, but it\'s not advanced calculus!!3.- My $35 DVD player has much more options to play a movie than this thing, that was a let down. I can\'t ""zoom"" for example, it\'s not as easy to call the movie menu or to advance to a particular scene.  It takes a few more buttons to turn own the subtitles or change the language/sound on a movie...but I guess otherwise the control would be too big...but still, it could have been made more efficient...so it is really geared to record stuff.4.- I tape TV programs mostly, \'cause I am never there when they play live, I don\'t dub VCR tapes to DVDs or mess around with pictures or MP3 (those I do all in my computer) so I don\'t know how those features would work for you.  But if you want something that tapes from your TV, the Hard Drive really delivers, you can record over 100 hrs of TV shows (so if you are gone for a couple of weeks it\'s great, my VCR stops at 8 hrs tops!)  But really that\'s all I got for $350, so all and all I\'m still not sure it was worth the money.5.- Delivered very fast from Amazon',)"
"('This is, by far, the best mouse I have ever owned. I used Microsoft for the longest time before I used this, and let me say that I will never again stray from Logitech for mice. This ""budget"" gaming mouse will outplay and outperform many of the flagships out there, even ones that are purportedly more sensitive (like Laser mice). In independent benchmarking, the MX-518 was identified as one of the best mice in terms of tracking speed, tracking fidelity, and smoothness of control, basically never skipping a beat at any (reasonable) surface movement speed.From my own experience, I can say that this thing tracks and handles like a dream. It never jitters and never lags. While the resolution adjustment buttons may seem superfluous to some, let me say that I thought the same thing, but now I don\'t want to touch a mice without them. You can change on the fly to suit your situation, or if a friend comes, he can change it to suit his own liking.The ergonomics are also great. This form is tried and true, and graces most Logitech mice. It\'s basically identical in shape to a G5. The mouse is comfortable, a good size, and is easy to grip for both palm and claw graspers. It has a smooth lip around the top that allows fantastic grip, and the lip also prevents you from accidentally hitting the side buttons.The buttons are crisp and responsive, and the mouse wheel is very well-designed. The scrolling is both smooth and sturdy, allowing you to select weapons accurately. The resistance on the mouse wheel (as a button) is flawless.The weight of the mouse is a matter of preference. It might be too light for some, and it\'s not adjustable like the G5/7/9. One thing is for sure, though--you won\'t be displeased about how it moves across your mousepad. The friction pads on the bottom are excellent, and the mouse glides effortlessly over almost all surfaces. Also, unlike friction feet, they don\'t get gunky or fall off.The mouse has a few drawbacks. The cord is a bit thick, and it can sometimes get stuck or push awkwardly against things, slowing your movement. The third button on top, which is designed like an ALT-TAB menu, is dangerous. I disabled it, because it can take you out of full-screen applications.The side buttons are a bit too sensitive for my liking, though you are unlikely to hit them because of the aforementioned lip. Also, the scroll wheel does not have side tilt, but some might consider side tilt to be a distraction.If you\'re okay with wireless mice, and you don\'t mind a relatively light mouse that doesn\'t have adjustable weight, this is a stellar choice. It\'s even good for non-gamers. I use the adjustable DPI when I\'m using Photoshop, as well.',)"
"('Great mouse, smooth, fits my hand perfectly, plenty of control with the many buttons.Might not fit everyones hand just right.',)"
"('Great gaming mouse. Not too fancy.  Gets the job done without having to spend too much time with setup.  Simple software.  Perfect for Call of Duty 4.',)"
"(""It says something that the MX-518 is still widely available despite being an older design than pretty much anything else currently out there (and yes, that includes the free mice Dell ships). Not to mention the fact that it's still marketed as gaming hardware, despite the fact that such products usually get updated on a yearly- if not monthly- basis. Take another Logitech product for example, the G15 keyboard, which is on its 4th or 5th iteration now depending on whether you count variants. A wired, non-laser, lightweight, 4-button+wheel design, the MX-518 might look pretty lame compared to some of the newer models offered by Razer, Logitech, Microsoft, or what have you. Looks can be deceiving, though: the MX-518 is an extremely accurate, reliable, and comfortable pointing device.I've used an MX-518 for over 3 years, during which it saw extensive daily use both for work and games. Aside from some of the paint wearing off, it works just as well today as it did when I got it. The precision of this mouse is such that it's really not distinguishable from much more expensive laser mice. The buttons are fully configurable and very well placed; it's second nature using them and does not cause any finger or wrist strain even after hours of use. If you need to adjust sensitivity on the fly, there's controls for that as well. The shape is ergonomically superior without being totally weird, and it functions well with or without a mousepad. It is also extremely tough- I've dropped it, stepped on it, tripped over the wire... you name it, it's survived it. On that note, it isn't a wireless and that's a plus in my opinion- it really seems the batteries on wireless mice die at the worst possible times.If you're looking for a high grade mouse that doesn't break the bank, look no further. The MX-518 is the champ of its class and will be for years to come."",)"
"('Bottom-Line: When it works the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" is a decent product though it could use a few more USB ports.Last year I bequeathed my old HP ZV5000z laptop computer to me 13-year-old daughter.  She had been begging me for a laptop computer and the ZV5000z with its 15"" TFT Active Matrix screen fit well in her remodeled room.  But of course what is a computer without a bunch of stuff hanging off of it like a printer, digital camera, MP3 player, and wireless keyboard and mouse, all of which demand their own USB port.  Enter the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" for $149.99.The ProductThe ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" is a port-replicator on steroids.  All of the usual port-replicator ports are present, plus a space of a slid-in external hard drive, a moveable platform upon which the notebook computer is placed, built-in speakers, and a wireless keyboard and mouse.  The ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" mates with the perspective notebook computer via a long connection that snakes out from under the platform and slides into a port on either the computers\' left or right-hand side.The only problem is that not all notebooks will mate with the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" out of the box, some like my, or rather my daughters zv5000V require an adapter which as it turns out is not sold with the HP xb2000; bad form!  At the time I order the product I was assured that the adapter would be in the box, there was even documentation about how to use it in the box, but no adapter.  So, I had to call HP and spend two very, very frustrating hours on the phone with India (there should be a law that any U.S. company selling goods in the U.S. has to have a U.S. based service and support organization, period), explaining my plight.  I got my adapter, but because it was on back order, I had to wait two months for it to show up!  And that is just the beginning of my problems with the product; more below.InstallationOnce the adapter arrived I set the whole thing up; thankfully there was no software to install on the notebook computer.  The ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" ships with a plain (no frills) wireless keyboard and mouse; their transceiver plugs into one of only (3) available USB ports.  With a unit this big and heavy I would expect there to be more USB ports, but...Network connectivity can be provided for via an RJ-45 Ethernet port, and there is an RJ-11 phone jack on the back of the unit as well.  Adjusting the platform is a bit cumbersome, but workable.  Head phone and microphone jacks can be found on the right hand side of the unit near the front.ProblemsThe expansion base adapter HP sent me failed to mate adequately or cleanly with the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base.""  The result: every time I moved the unit even a little a hideous crackling sound would emanate from the speakers.  Eventually after four months of non-heavy use, they stopped working; ditto for the USB ports.So I called HP and after bouncing around from department to department was told that my unit was no longer under warranty despite the fact that I bought the expansion base in May of last year.  So of course I argued and was hung up on twice!  Eventually I email the service tech my invoice showing the purchase date and a replacement in on the way.ConclusionWhen it works the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" is a decent product though it could use a few more USB ports.  Perhaps my unit is a lemon, but it is being replaced so...My daughter like the ""HP xb2000 Notebook Expansion Base"" because of the speakers, I like it because of the wireless keyboard and mouse as well as the USB ports.  Word to the wise: before buying one, make sure your notebook computer will mate with it right out of the box!',)"
"(""Just received the lens a day ago and tested throughly. Great!(Using this lens on my Nikon D200)At first, I was extremely sceptical about purchasing a Sigma lens - this lens. I used two Sigma lenses before for my Canon EOS-3 and found them a bit too soft for my taste. Nevertheless, I finally went ahead after being lost with all types of negative and positive reviews.Good decission.The lens is sharp! Shooting under all types of conditions including flash and low light, I can somewhat confirm that there is a slight softness shooting with f/2.8. The lens becomes very sharp at f/4 and tack sharp at 5.6 to f/8 aperture. The differences are extremely small and merely visible by enlarging the frame to an extreme size, much larger than anyone would do in normal practice. Most lenses getting to their high with one or two stops above 2.8 aperture, to include pro lenses. I do like the slight creamy type (almost) softness at f/2.8 of this Sigma lens which produced great skin for portraits during my testing. In all, the sharpness is more than satisfying and top level. Color reproduction is also extremely good and almost vivid. Great lens! (I am a professional photo-journalist for more than 30 years and used to top lenses and pro equipment).Build quality is good and in the upper class of pro lenses. It is a heavy and large lens but what do you expect if you want pro performance. This lens is still not as heavy as similar pro lenses from Canon or Nikon. I can carry this lens all day without too much neck pain and I securely hand hold this lens down to 30 shutter speed and get good results at every single shot.Some reviews complain about the lens is extending by zooming ( I was sceptical about that issue) but it does not bother and the movement is only about an inch or so. Lens movement feels smooth and solid. This lens focused very fast and precise even in low light condition - no creeping and searching. Focusing is precise. The lens motor has a slight humming noise which sounds smooth and is everything but disturbing - I can live with it. More critics about the filter size! The filter size in the lens description above is wrong. It is not 62mm but 82mm. I have no problems at all finding filters with 82mm in all price and quality ranges. By the way, you can use 77 filter sizes with step down ring if you don't use this lens on a full frame camera - works just fine without vignetting...There is a bit of a shade if you shoot wide with your build in flash because of the large lens size which is surely normal. You get anyway better results with a normal flash...All in all a great pro level lens which will satisfy everyone in all aspects.Handling is very good. It takes a few moments to get used to the smaller zooming ring at the rear of the lens and I surely turned at first a few times on the focusing ring. I got used to that after a few shots and truly like it that way. Holding the camera on the bottom with your left hand, the zooming ring simply falls into your fingers quite naturally.My final opinion: I love this lens!My compliments to the Sigma people - great lens.The zoom range of 24-70mm is very convenient for me. I am primary a street and inside shooter. 24mm is wide enough to get a normal group of people inside, and 70mm gives me a large enough frame to cover fair distances. My ideal walk around lens for all eventualities.The lens protrudes my camera 4.5 inches (an inch more with lens hood) and is a bit below 3.5 inches in diameter.The lens is extremely cheap for the quality and performance - buy it before Sigma realizes their mistake and jacks up the price...I guess the only problem I had was the price. I simply could not imagine that a lens in this price range could be that good. Surprise!!!"",)"
"('I had read quite a few reviews of this lens before buying it for my D300. Some were great and others not so great.  I picked it up to use as a portrait lens for location shoots.  I haven\'t experienced any problems whatsoever.  Some say it\'s soft at f2.8.  Not mine.  Tack sharp at all focal lengths.  Some say the Autofocus is noisy(loud.)  Not mine.  Or maybe I\'m just not that picky.  If noisy means you can hear it then...yeah it can be noisy.  Some say that the autofocus hunts.  Not mine.  In fact this lens focuses so fast I was amazed.  Color rendition is good.  Contrast is good.  Bokeh is nice and smooth.People raved about the Nikon 18-200vr so I bought one.  It\'s soft and slow in my experience.  It was ""ok"" on my D70 but its flaws were multiplied on my d300.  So even with the good reviews of this lens I was really worried about buying it but the price made me give it a try.  I\'m so glad I did.  I could easily slip into another good Sigma or halfway decent Nikon lens with the money I saved over going with the Nikon equivalent.  It makes me wonder how their competitor to Nikon\'s 18-200vr stacks up.My only ""complaint"" about this lens is that the zoom ring is small, stiff, and at the base of the lens.  It\'s sometimes hard to get to and a bit backward from what I\'m used to.  A minor annoyance is that switching to manual focus is a 2 step process.  The lens will stay in autofocus even after locking the clutch down as long as the camera is still in autofocus.  Be careful with this because you could damage your camera\'s motor drive if you have a tight grip on your lens. You\'ll know the lens is set to manual when you try to focus and the focus ring turns on its own.  I also found it odd that the lens is at it shortest when zoomed all the way in and longest when backed off to 24mm.  Strange...maybe I\'m missing something here but all my other zooms are the opposite.It\'s big and bulky.  I actually like this because I have big hands and find it easier to stabilize heavier equipment.  And as dumb as it sounds...it looks good on the camera.  Those out of ""the-know"" will judge you based on these types of things at times.Nice big lens = professional right?As long as you\'re a potential paying customer...um...yeah! Of course!I haven\'t had a chance to try it out yet but I\'ve heard some people complain about lens flare and that hood is useless to protect against it.  I like lens flare and use it creatively in my own photography so it\'s not anything I would consider a minus. For me a lens hood is something I use to keep from bumping the end of my lens into stuff.  I can see though how people could get annoyed if it\'s unexpected.  But if you\'re getting unexpected flare in your shots you\'re not doing your job as a photographer and paying proper attention to your scene.Update 6/17/2008I\'ve been shooting with this lens for a few weeks now and my above observations are accurate.  However the lens flare issue is a bit more than I thought.  I had a hard time getting the ""touch of flair"" I like in some backlit shots.  It was more like ""holy crap that\'s a lot of flair!""  The hood does seem a bit useless but I tend to bump into stuff so it\'s good to protect the end of the lens.  I\'d still buy it and fully recommend it at 5 stars.',)"

"('(This review is for the PXC 300)This is a well-executed product, but since there are some compromises, I\'ll give it a 4.5.I was looking for something that would isolate me from ambient noise in our open office arrangement.  I have some nice Shure E2Cs, and some Sennheiser over-the-ear phones -- but the Shure buds require more fiddling if someone drops by your desk, and the larger phones look a bit anti-social.Don\'t expect full spectrum, noise free performance from any active noise canceling headphones.  It won\'t happen, and I have other headphones/earbuds which offer better spectral performance.  But in the office or on the plane I\'m just trying to listen to something decent and to control background noise by means OTHER than cranking up the headphone volume.  Pay three times more for the Bose, and you merely paid three times more.These Sennheisers beat the Bose models because you can use them in the passive mode (battery off) as ""regular"" headphones should you wish to remain entertained by the airplane\'s armrest (United Channel 9:  ""Wow!  That was a close one!""), or if the batteries die.These phones are lightweight but not flimsy.  I like how Sennheiser decided to put the circuitry and battery in the ""pen"".  It has a rotating belt clip so you can attach it horizontally (cables on the right or left) or vertically (cables from the top or bottom).  You could even attach it to a neck chain or cord (or one of those goofy ID/passport/ticket holders.I was a little concerned about comfort with this ""on-ear"" style, (a pair of Aiwa NC phones I have get uncomfortable) but after a couple of days in the office, these seem much less irritating.The zippered, semi-hard case is good, though there is no really convenient way to secure the cords.  If you get these phones, use the case...Take care of your stuff and your stuff will take care of you.And is it my imagination?  Or does turning in the noise reduction also crank up the bass a little?Anyway...I\'m glad I bought these and I think they\'re going to work out just fine.',)"

"(""I bought this projector several months ago, so I've had a chance to get used to it and can share all that with other Amazon customers.The Good:If you don't know much or anything about home theater, and you don't want to learn about what 1080i, 720p, 480p and all the other techno mumbo-jumbo means, you can hardly go by buying this product.  Out of the box, the unit seemed pretty darn good.  I played a little with brightness and contrast to make the blacks look a little blacker.  Overall, the images are very good.  This is a 480p projector, so although you can pipe-in high-def programming, you WILL NOT get true high-definition video displayed on your wall or your movie screen.  That said, the images are still going to look very good, crisp and clear.  For most people, the 480p native resolution shouldn't be a deal-breaker.The convenience is really excellent.  Optoma did right by packing everything in a handy, sturdy tote (but don't drop the bag, as the cushioning is minimal).  Tote it easily to a friend's house or set it up outside to have outdoor movie night -- that's what we do, and it's been a great hit with our friends and their kids.  It's as easy as plugging it in, turning it on, popping in a DVD and hitting Play.  My wife and I set it up on our bed (I put the projector on top of a cookie sheet) and we watch movies in comfortably in bed now, so our young kids don't hear the movie audio.It's very affordable.  If you find you really aren't going to use a projector very often, you're out hundreds of dollars, not thousands.The Bad:The built-in speakers are adequate for a bedroom, but in a larger setting they aren't too good.  Outside, you MUST use extra amplification -- I hook up the projector to a boom box, and even with the volume turned up on the projector AND the boombox, the audio output is just passable.  Obviously, you're not going to get much bass from these speakers.  But then, this is a highly portable unit, so that's the trade-off.Some projector settings don't appear to be retained after I turn it off and unplug it.  For instance, I always have to manually turn off the Brite Mode (economizes the lamp life) -- the project doesn't retain this setting.  Other settings are retained, though, like Brightness and Contrast.  It's a little nettlesome to have to bother changing the Brite Mode setting each time.When I use the projector hooked up to my laptop, the character output isn't that great.  This could be a projector setting issue (my problem), but you won't get great results without tweaking the projector, if that's even possible.  It'd be fine for Powerpoint slides, but you wouldn't want to look at spreadsheet data in a 12-point font using this set-up.The Ugly:The only ugly thing is that the light output is so dim, you really have to use this projector in a dark or almost-dark room.  Forget about using it in the daytime, even indoors with the shades drawn -- it's just too dim to cast an acceptable brightness and color level.  The image will be too washed out to be enjoyed.  But as long as you can control your environment (or conform to it by watching movies outdoors only at night), then this will be a great solution.So, I recommend this unit.  I wish it had better speakers (5 watt speakers is better than average projectors, but they still leave a lot to be desired).  I wish it cast a brighter image.  But living under those constraints isn't too bad for the money I paid.  I'm glad I bought it, and we use it just about every week now."",)"

"('I bought a pair of these as outdoor deck/ambiance speakers as temporaries while I decide on a higher end next season, and after hearing them, I really don\'t think I\'ll even be bothering with looking next year. these sound really great for the price.Construction: the body is plastic, as are most of the thumb screws that attach the brackets to the speakers, but the plastic feels sturdy and thick enough not to tone the sound too much, the bracket is stamped, hardened steel, painted to match. the speakers have small amounts of vibration damping material where they meet the brackets, which is nice if for nothing else to keep the speakers exactly where you set them.Drivers:woofer: appears to be 4.25"", foam surround and plastic composite conemid: plastic cone, plastic surround.tweeter: plastic dome tweeternot high end stuff, but feels and looks like it\'ll last at least a few years.aesthetics: they look just fine, they\'re pretty small at 5.5"" wide but that\'s again not a bad thing inherently. the \'dual\' logo does rotate to accommodate any orientation you choose, but its hardly visible from 5 feet and almost looks like a \'JBL\' logo (observation, not really relevant).Sound: before I start critiquing these, I want to say that I\'ll be comparing these to a vastly different Klipsch set I have in my garage, and I was not at all expecting these to sound good.At low volumes, these are very well balanced and even have a little bit of their own presence. when I researched these, I noticed the frequency response wasn\'t impressive at all, but I am very impressed with the low range response for a 4.25"" woofer. the highs are a bit shrill which is jut the nature of this type of tweeter. the sound doesn\'t give me a headache, and can be somewhat cured with a treble adjustment. the mid-range of the speaker is really only apparent in low volumes... which if we\'re honest, is where 99% of these speakers sold will ever be used.at high volumes (and here is where I was surprised) they don\'t want to distort, and they don\'t feel uncomfortable. the bass keeps on par with the highs, and the mids are a bit lacking.Durability:I burned in two sets of these (one new, one Amazon.com warehouse deals \'used\') for 50 hours with a 100W RMS amp at something like 20W@8ohmsthey didn\'t really loosen up much (because the surrounds aren\'t Butyl rubber and the driver material is lower end) but I am confident after that that I will never blow these speakers, and the only way they\'ll ever die is one of two ways: if an animal eats through the grill and ruins the foam surround, or if the foam surround just breaks down with use and weather elements (in Minnesota winters, etc).Other Thoughts:the grills aren\'t meant to be removed, but they look exactly as pictured on here with the grilles off (which is pretty nice, actually)they feel higher quality than $10-15/speaker.they sound WAY better than $10-15/speaker.I say well done, Dual.a company that used to make complete crap has maybe stepped out of it\'s awkward teens and into maturity.',)"
"('When people say that these speakers are junk, don\'t listen.  Sure Bose and Yamaha speakers sound better (especially indoors), but that\'s okay because these speakers cost 1/10 the price of those brands.  When you live in a place like Wisconsin off the shores of a lake, there\'s no way one can pay the price for good speakers, so I thought I\'d give these a try.  A just one day after I received the pair, I ordered 3 more pairs.Here\'s what I\'ve found:These speakers are absolutely amazing for the price!  Outdoors, these speakers sound like they cost 5 times as much.  They really do deliver good sound.  (Note: these speakers don\'t sound too good indoors, but that\'s okay)  The speakers (if used with the right gauge wire and according to specifications) Deliver excellent sounds and can actually pump out the noise quite well.  There is little to no distortion, the highs and lows are great, and the fact that the speakers are 3-way is even better.  The quality of the speaker itself is terrific.  However, to be honest, the mounting isn\'t that good.  But, its simple enough to reinforce it.I have 5 zones around my house outdoors (one with rock speakers) and use 14 gauge wire, with my longest run being just under 100 feet.  I\'d recommend this gauge wire for any lengths 25\'-200\'.Coleman Cable 09504 14/2 Low Voltage Direct Burial Garden Light Cable, Black, 100-FeetIs an EXCELLENT wire to choose from.  Do not waste money buying outdoor speaker wire, its a scam.  Just buy landscaping wire, it is meant to be buried and withstand the outdoors.  I cannot foresee the plastic on this wire diminish in any way.

"('I own the Aiptek Hyperpen 12000u graphics tablet, which is the exact same item as the Adesso CyberTablet 12000, only it is sold under the Aiptek brand.I went to school for Graphic Design and in 2006 I graduated with my bachelors in that field. I currently work full time for at an in-house graphic design department for one of the world\'s largest printing and marketing companies.I bought this tablet in about 2003 because I felt that it would help with my projects in school. I originally was looking at the Wacom Intuos 6x8 graphics tablet, but the price tag for that particular item was far outside what I could afford while paying for school, my car and other bills. I had used the less expensive Wacom Graphire 4x5"" tablet but I was not impressed. The build quality was good, but it was too small to really do any kind of detailed work with it.A friend of mine who does a lot of artwork on the computer turned me onto the Aiptek 12000u (which is again, the same unit as the CyberTablet 12000) which he paid about double the price here for at a local brick and mortar hardware chain. A 12x9 tablet for about half the cost of the Wacom Intuos I was looking at caught my attention so I looked online, found the tablet on Amazon and did what any college kid would do, asked my parents to buy it for me.The build quality of the Hyperpen is good. It is a solid unit over-all. I have dropped mine dozens of times and it still works flawlessly. The pen feels a little flimsy, but no worse than say a bic pen. Mine lasted for about 4 years before I had to recently replace it (replacements available on the Aiptek website). A replacement pen cost me only $10 plus shipping, which is a great value considering a replacement pen for a Wacom tablet costs in the $60 range. The pen requires a AAA battery and because of this is a little heavier than a Wacom pen, but almost all of the weight is the battery itself, and I am one of those people who prefer a pen with a little heft to it. For me the vast savings over the cost of a Wacom tablet outweigh having to use a slightly heavier pen.The mouse of my tablet was basically useless. But I didn\'t buy a tablet to use the mouse. I have a very decent optical mouse that fulfills all of my mousing needs, as I am sure most people who are considering this tablet do.I use this tablet nearly every day at work and it performs flawlessly. I use it mainly with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and 3, and Adobe Illustrator CS2 and for those programs it is worth its weight in gold. It has full pressure sensitivity for CS2 and 3 (contrary to what some reviews say) and works well with Illustrator. You have to install the drivers (the drivers on the Aiptek website, which I believe are v3.15 will work well with this tablet) in order for Photoshop to detect the pen pressure sensitivity, but that is no big deal.Also this tablet has only 512 levels of pressure sensitivity as compared to 1024 levels on the Wacom Intuos  line. But I have used both tablets (12000u and Intuos 6x8"") at this point, and there is no real world difference between the two. As in, you won\'t really notice any difference in pen pressure sensitivity.Also this tablet is very accurate. I have it set up with ""Absolute"" positioning so that where I place the pen on the tablet directly relates to where the cursor appears on the screen, and with my 20"" monitor using this tablet is very intuitive. I got used to it in a week, which is something I cannot say of smaller tablets.Aside from the crappy mouse this tablet comes with, I only have 2 other negative things to say: The programmable function keys are practically useless. You cannot program them to Photoshop keyboard shortcuts or macros. I have only been able to use them to open programs. The other thing is that this tablet doesn\'t detect pen tilt, which is something the newer Wacom tablets do. It\'s not a major feature, but it is a nice one.However the extra $300+ dollars that I have in my pocket make me feel better about not having tilt sensing on my tablet.I would as always recommend this tablet to anyone who thinks they might want one, but cannot or will not spend a lot more money for a Wacom Tablet. If you have a lot of money to spend, definitely go with the Wacom, they are nicer, but if like most people you have to budget how much you spend, this Adesso CyberTablet 12000 is an incredible purchase for the money.',)"

"('The Olympus DS-2 Digital Voice Recorder is one of those breakthrough products that makes me want to recommend it to everyone I see.Digital voice recorders have been around for a number of years and I have owned a few, a Sony and an older Olympus model. They have previously been very disappointing, mostly because of the poor sound quality. Comparing the DS-2 to older digital voice recorders is like comparing a high-end stereo system with a Victrola.The DS-2 is a reasonably sized, very configurable digital voice recorder. But the term ""voice recorder"" is not the best description of this little gem. You will discover, as I did, that the quality of recording can be so good that you can easily record music and be quite satisfied with the incredible sound. It has a built-in stereo microphone and you can also attach an external stereo (or mono) microphone using the mini-jack mic input.The built in speaker has decent output for its size. You can also use headphones or connect to a stereo or other audio device using the headphone output jack. I use a cassette tape adapter in my car which enables me to listen to my audio notes on my car stereo while driving.The DS-2 has 5 different recording modes. 2 of them are Stereo (Stereo HQ-Stereo High Quality recording and Stereo SP-Stereo Standard recording) and the other 3 are mono (HQ-high quality, SP-standard recording, LP-long term recording). Olympus uses two different recording formats, WMA and DSS, depending on which recording mode you are in. WMA mode is used for all stereo recordings as well as the highest quality mono mode (HQ). The DSS format is used for the 2 lesser quality recording modes, SP and LP.Recording time for the DS-2 can be as much as 22 Hours 20 Minutes in LP mode and as short as 1 Hour 5 Minutes in Stereo HQ mode. If you are using the DS-2 strictly for dictation or general voice reminders, you will be quite pleased with the recording quality in the lowest quality mode, LP. And remember that in this mode you can record for over 22 hours. I think that is pretty amazing. If you bump up the quality to SP, you can still record for over 10 hours. HQ mode records for over 4 hours. Stereo SP mode records for over 2 hours and Stereo HQ mode records for just over 1 hour.You can alternate recording modes and your total time will adjust according to whatever mode you happen to be in.The DS-2 display is small but more than adequate. The text is sharp and clear, while the back-lighting makes visibility excellent during daylight or in dark situations. There is contrast adjustmentThe unit uses 2-AAA batteries. You can also use NIMH batteries if you want to be able to recharge batteries. Battery life is pretty good averaging about 10-12 hour while recording or 8-10 hours of playback.The unit also comes with a USB docking station and software which works on both Macs and PCs. This enables you to upload audio files to your computer where you can then listen to them or just store themHere are some of the other features of this device...-5 folders which can hold 199 files each for a maximum of 995 recordings. You can also name your folders something other than the default ""Folder A, Folder B"", etc. There are also some pre-set folder names available such as """"Meeting"", ""Memo"", ""Note"", and so on. Although it is tedious to change folder names on the player itself, using the DSS software and making the changes via the computer is a breeze.-VCVA (variable control voice actuator). A fancy phrase that simply means you can set the device to only record when a certain loudness threshold has been reached. This enables you to avoid recording silence thus effectively extending the total recording time. This feature is very adjustable and you can adjust it to compensate for ambient background noise.-Mic sensitivity can be adjusted for either ""Dictation"" which is lower sensitivity or ""Conference"" which is high sensitivity.-Timer record function lets you set the recorder to begin recording at a specified time.-File Comments: You can enter up to 100 characters to name a file. There are also 10 pre-set comments such as ""Important"", ""Confidential"", ""Priority"" and so on. Although it is tedious to add file comments on the player itself, using the DSS software and making the changes via the computer is a breeze.-Noise Cancel Function: The recorder has a feature to reduce background noise during playback. This can be useful if the recording was made in an environment with a lot of background noise.-Alarm: You can specify a time for an alarm to sound and you can also attach a specific file to play after the alarm is turned off. This is a great feature for giving you audio reminders at specified times.-Variable playback speed: You can vary the playback speed in intervals up to 2x. This is great for listening to long recordings in half the time.-Index Marks: You can ""mark"" files during recording or playback with up to 16 index marks per file. This is handy for quickly accessing specific parts of a long lecture, for instance.-Files can be moved from one folder to another.-The device can also be used as external memory for your computer...for the transport of files to another computer for instance.The features are numerous, but easily accessed via an intuitive menu system.I absolutely love this little device. It is an excellent performer with great features at a very good price. It is an excellent value overall.',)"
"('I searched long and hard to find the best digital voice recorder possible. My goals were simple: record conference calls and the ever more important meetings but without anyone seeing or noticing the recorder - I\'m  hard of hearing and use this to go back to fill in my notes.First the microphone quality is astounding. Not only does it pick up the conversation of everyone in a large conference room FROM MY BRIEFCASE but the included software has a noise cancellation feature that works very well! If you need something that can pickup conversations from your pocket without an external microphone then this is for you. Basic recording is (thankfully) where its strength is.Pros: Good price at $100 from Amazon - Best Buy had it for around $150! Microphone quality is extremely good especially for concealed recording from pocket or bag. Very easy to use. Can use rechargeable batteries and doesn\'t drain them too fast.Cons: First and foremost the cable that plugs the recorder into the computer is  ONE OF A KIND! It\'s a USB style plug but the end that plugs into the DS-2 is specific for it and it alone. If you loose it you\'re out of luck and may have to order a new one. Protect this cable with your LIFE! If you\'re on a business trip and forget it you\'ll be out of luck and listening off the recorder itself can be tedious and annoying.Second: in stereo quality or high quality modes you\'re only getting 2-4hrs of record time. In full standard mode you can get 10 hours of recording. I\'m not sure where they get the 22hrs as advertised because at that ULTRA LOW quality setting you\'d be lucky to pick up a train running over it.Third: very minor but the fast-forward button only ""skips"" every other second. You can speed up playback on the computer but if you want to que up a certain part of your recording it can be very tedious.Fourth: Go figure on this one: the software included supposedly allows you to plug in the recorder and get an automatic transfer of your audio files to the computer. Having tried this on three separate PCs and a Mac it\'s never worked - could be just me.Update 09/06/08After a year using it I have an update.Still a great recorder. It records conference calls perfectly and can still record a large conference room from inside my messenger bag. However the software is the only problem. If you lose it, you\'re screwed. You\'ll have to spend $40 to buy the thing over again. Sometimes the software will recognize the DS-2, sometimes it won\'t. I have guarded the cable with my life and while I have seen that you could purchase the type of cable online for about $20 it\'s still not a widely used format. Guard the CD-Key. If you lose it Olympus will give you another one if you ask very nicely. I have used the DS-2 on my Mac, though the player software isn\'t too good, but you can access it as a storage drive and move the wmv files off easily. Overall it\'s been a lifesaver.',)"
"('Tom Tom is one of the newer GPS makers to do business in the US, and I was very pleased to get a chance to try out the GO 700.First, a discussion of basic usability: it\'s very good! The box promises that you can just turn it on and go, and it\'s true. You don\'t need to hook it up to a computer first, and there is no aggravating ""activation"" step.The user interface is very different than what I am used to from competing products, being as it is all touch-screen aside from the power button. The tasks and various preferences are also arranged differently than I am accustomed to. Not that it\'s bad . . . just different. It is at least the equal of its major competitors in ease of use, and probably better in customizability, such as map colors.Speaking of the map, it has a pleasant smooth scroll as you drive, and an easy to read 3d perspective mode. All of the text is sharp and readable, though some fiddly bits like satellite status numbers are rather small.The windshield sucker mount is great. It\'s the best I have seen on such a product and it may even be better than my trusty old RAM mount.The built-in Bluetooth speakerphone should work with most Bluetooth mobile phones. It did not have a problem with my Sony Ericsson S710a, which is relatively new as of this writing. Sound quality for both parties is quite good, but there is no support for my phone\'s voice dialing and answering features-I suspect that all phones with voice dialing will suffer this way. But fortunately the GO 700 will grab your phone\'s address book and let you choose a number from it on the touch screen, which is an adequate compromise for the lack of voice dialing. Answering (or rejecting) a call is just a matter of pushing a big button that pops up when a call is coming in.So that\'s all good, but there are two other very neat things about the GO 700. For one, the voices. They are very clear and high-quality, noticeably better than anything else I have heard in a car GPS. You can purchase additional fun voices from the TomTom web site, if you want. One of them is even John Cleese, though it will cost you about $10 to get him. The other voices are about $5.The other simple yet very pleasant feature is the built-in rechargeable battery. When fully charged off the included auto adapter, the GO 700 will run for a few hours all by itself. That means you can take it for a walk in the city, or grab it for a trip in someone else\'s car without worrying about power.Speaking of trips, I would put the quality of the routing and verbal directions on par with everything else I have tried. Honestly, all the major makers seem to do a good job with this. Of course for any GPS product there is local variation in the quality of the maps, but in my area (around Seattle and Los Angeles) the GO 700 is fine though I did not get a chance to test LA freeway exits much. Quality of the GPS receiver seems to be very good.On the down side, we have the screen. I have read other reviews that state it is unusable in sunlight, but I find that to be an exaggeration. There is certainly a drop in contrast, moreso than I see in the big competitors, but I find the screen to remain usable in all lighting conditions, even direct sunlight. I would not rule the GO 700 out for this reason, but it is something to be aware of.What about reliability? Well, no problems so far. The device uses a 2.5 GB hard drive, not flash memory. Hard drives can die, so caveat emptor.Now, a big part of the Tom Tom offering is their ""plus"" service, which is premium downloads straight to your GPS over your mobile phone. That\'s points of interest, voices, extra maps, and real-time traffic information. Pretty cool, but this service is not for everyone. For one, you need a GSM mobile phone and an active data account... that\'s at least an extra $20 on your phone bill. For another, the services themselves are not cheap. A yearly subscription to UK traffic is over $60, and American traffic data is not even available yet. Same with POIs . . . UK safety cameras are over $70 for a yearly subscription. I didn\'t see any US POIs.Now for a constant business driver, that could be worth it... but if your main use for a GPS is to not get lost when driving to some new spot across town, these advanced data features are not worth their additional cost. And more to the point, they aren\'t even available in the US. (Tom Tom is a European company, but I had hoped they would have better data support for their US customers.)Speaking of POIs, this is where I found my one and only ""hate it!"" issue. You can\'t look up POIs by name alone. You must specify a category first. So is that big museum downtown a, uh, Museum? Cultural Center? Exhibition Center? Or maybe a Tourist Attraction? You won\'t know until you search each of those categories.Lastly, the included PC software will let you back up your settings to your PC. (The GO 700 shows up like a USB drive under Windows.) By the way, if the thought of downloading a high-quality voice over your mobile phone data connection freaks you out, you can do Tom Tom Plus data transfers through your PC instead.Other than the disappointing Plus services, I was pretty impressed with the GO 700. The quality of the hardware and software is very good, and it works as advertised. The next time I have to recommend a car GPS to someone, the Tom Tom GO series will be a serious contender.',)"
"(""I have been eyeing both this model and the 26inch model for months.  I recently moved to Tokyo Japan, and given the small apt space that is the norm here, I settled on the 23inch version.What originally enticed me about this LCD was its exceptional picture quality.  This can been seen everywhere on Xbox360 kiosks.  The contrast ratio is great, and the brightness is just right.  Picture very sharp.I then researched for months, with regards to the usablity of this LCD HD TV as a viable PC Monitor.  I found the information on the Amazon reviews lacking on this topic, so I will address it here.I bought a new, high end SVGA cable to go with my purchase.  I wasn't sure if my old video cable was fine or not, but at &lt;$10, I ordered it together with this LCD TV.  I would urge you to do the same.  Setup was a snap, I plugged in my PC to the LCD, and it just boots up like any other monitor.  The LCD displays MANY resolutions, NOT just 1388 by 768.  My video card actually doesn't do that resolution, but I am using 1280 by 768, and I'm very impressed still.  The images are crisp and sharp, unlike your traditional LCD monitors, where if you don't use the native resolution, the picture looks like crap.One more thing, this HD LCD as a PC monitor can also run many low resolution games.  I tried a few emulators, and I was blown away.  Old arcade games were using the entire wide screen even though the resolution was not at 1388 x 768 standard.  I was using MAME to test these games.  Final Fight, Street Fighter, it was like a theather experience to the blasts from the past!I love this TV.  Go for it.  $600-$700 bucks is soooooo worth it.I didn't really cover the Non-PC usage here, but the other reviews should cover that topic.  I'm using Component Video to my Progressive scan DVD player, and using Panoramic/16:9 wide screen mode for the movie.  Looks terrific.  No ghosting at all.Did I mention I love this ?  If you want a good multi-function LCD/HD-TV that kicks butt at all applications, you have found it here."",)"
"('This is my fourth Dell monitor and they have all held up well.  I got this to use as my primary monitor replacing my 21"" Dell / Sony Trinitron CRT.  While it is slightly inferior in specifications to the Trinitron in a few areas, it more than makes up for it in other areas:1.) It has a much smaller footprint than the CRT and this means more desk space.2.) My guess is this weighs 15 pounds with the stand, my 21"" CRT weighs 70 pounds3.) LCD uses much less energy than a CRT4.) LCD emits much less heat than a CRT (great as I am writing this on a hot August night)5.) Much more mobile than a CRT6.) It looks really cool with its sleek, modern stylingThis is a great monitor and you get much more in terms of features compared to the models you will find at your local big box store.  Look at all the features I list below and you will see few if any of these features come on the typical models sold at the brick-and-mortar stores.The monitor has four USB ports built in (two on the back and two on the left side) and this is very handy.  You can never have enough of these and I keep my computer under my desk so the ports on the monitor are much easier to access.  It also keeps cords from getting tangled up by allowing me to keep some items above the desk and away from the computer.  The stand also has a nice cord management spacer built in.The stand is among the best I have seen and it pivots and tilts.  You can elevate the display about a foot with the sliding stand.  And you can easily tilt the monitor up, down and to the right or left.  It can even be rotated 180 degrees to a portrait mode with ease.  It offers both DVI and SVGA connections so you can have two computers hooked up at once (one digital and one analog).  If your video card supports it, the DVI connection will eliminate the flicker problem many CRTs experience.The actual screen area is 11.85"" in height and 14.82"" in width (175.6 square inch viewing area and 1,310,720 pixels).  For comparison, the viewable screen on my 21"" CRT was 12"" in height and 16"" in width.The 250 nits brightness is plenty bright and the 800:1 contrast is superior to that found on much more expensive models.  The only area for improvement is the 20-25 ms response time, but it serves my purposes well as I never play video games.  These displays are also made in China or Mexico instead of Japan where Dell\'s better monitors were made in the past.You can download a free program named Dead Pixel Buddy (just Google this) which allows you to test for dead pixels on your display, and mine had zero when I ran the test.Dell has a great return policy and although others complain, I find the outsourced customer service in India to be helpful whenever I need them.Dell also makes some nice widescreen models, but I\'d check to see if your video card can handle them before you consider those models.  This one is a no-brainer and you just plug it in and Windows XP recognizes the monitor.I got mine for just over $200.  You have to be patient when buying a Dell, they run great specials around the end of their financial quarter.I also recommend getting the sound bar for this monitor.  The monitor has a power plug to input the sound bar into.  It is silver, attractive and complements the monitor well.  It snaps onto the bottom of the monitor, is about an inch long and runs along the length of the bottom of the monitor.',)"

"('I\'m a videophile and I wouldn\'t buy a DVD Recorder until one was made that burns to a double layered disc, and it had to have an iLink port.  As far as I know this is the only one that does it yet.  I instantly felt an obligation to post here, as this site is an excellent source for consumers to share their experiences.First the bad news.  DO NOT USE DVD-RW discs!!!!  I was dumb, I bought Memorex\'s Dual Layered RW (re-writable) discs, and the video on the first recording would intermittantly block up.  I\'m hesitant to call fowl on Sony for that though, because Memorex claims that RW\'s are NOT ideal for recording video on to be played back in DVD Players.  So, if you\'re going to buy Sony\'s VRD-VC20 then also buy DVD+R discs or DVD-R discs, but NOT DVD-RW discs!Secondly, I\'m dissappointed that at the highest quality setting Sony only gives you 119 minutes of recording time, that is dissappointing, it should be at least 2 full hours (120 minutes) or more, but this is more of a pet peave of mine.Thirdly, there is no 3 hour recording setting for dual layered discs?!  Why?!  A three hour record algorithm is already a consideration by other manufacturers.  There OUGHT to be one for this unit, I\'m hoping Sony has made it\'s firmware upgradable so as to fix this, and I don\'t just mean adding an extra bit every so often to the SP setting, just to fill up the disc at 3 hours, what I mean is Sony needs to design a 3 hour recording algorithm for writing to dual layered discs!  Sony, if you are reading this, please tell me my VRD-VC20 can be flashed to having a new algorithm between HQ and SP....  PLEASE!Also, Finalizing the discs takes about 10 minutes, so brush your teeth and make some popcorn, and then it\'ll be finished.OK, I\'m done wining.  I do suggest to the rest of you consumers to buy this unit and also buy DVD+R recordable discs and NOT buy DVD-RW discs.On the HQ setting it records the image perfectly, good job Sony.  I\'ve made my only rcording so far from the S-Video port and I have yet to record from the iLink port but I am axious to do that.Many consumers posting to this site on the older ""VRD-VC10"" complained that the drive was always stopping because it sensed copyright protection.  Thats because analog video sources (such as the signals coming from VHS, SVHS, Video8, Hi8, Betamax and Super Betamax) often have time shifting errors in the horizontal sync of the video (which is part of the video signal above and below the image that you can\'t see on a normal TV).  So you shouldn\'t have that problem using the iLink because it\'s not Analog it\'s Digital.With all this considered, I am hopeful that as soon as I get some blank DVD+R dual layered discs and NOT DVD-RW discs, I\'ll be very happy with this unit, although I admit I\'ve only made one recording so far and that was with the RW discs and I\'m just assuming that the problem is that RW discs aren\'t ideal for this unit.I hope this helps you.',)"
"('Like many reviewers, here and elsewhere, I chose this subwoofer mainly to save on space and to simplify installation - i.e. no separate amp.  No car I\'ve ever owned has had a subwoofer, but now that they\'re standard on home theater and PC speaker systems, the absence of bass in the car had become noticeable.  I wasn\'t seeking the other extreme of conspicuous pounding low frequencies, and I wanted to preserve the cargo space in my 1999 Outback wagon unobstructed by a speaker box.  The KSC-SW1 certainly meets my needs, filling out the mids and trebles without upstaging them.  Even though my Pioneer head unit will control the subwoofer volume and low-pass frequency, I find the wired remote very handy for making quick adjustments based on the kind of music and the driving situation.Some notes on installation, for do-it-yourselfers:I\'d planned to hide this under the driver\'s seat of my Subaru, but discovered that it wouldn\'t fit because of that seat\'s two steel cross-members - btw, the KSC-SW1\'s dimensions are 15-3/4""x 3-9/16""x9"".  Luckily the passenger seat does have enough space underneath - just barely, but this is actually a plus because you do want this thing to stay snugly lodged in place.  (I had to remove a 6-CD changer that I wasn\'t using anyway because of the mp3/USB head unit I\'d installed.)  I also tried the velcro approach to anchoring the unit to the carpeting (using the ""xtreme"" version).  Though it wouldn\'t cling very well, the seat rails hold down the unit vertically and the velcro hooks do keep it from sliding horizontally, the only possible direction it can move while under the seat.The 19-ft wiring harness is much too long for an under-seat installation, but the Outback\'s center console has a big enough cavity to stuff all the unused wiring inside.  I used the RCA inputs but didn\'t want to cut the speaker line-in wires.  Likewise the excess length of the yellow power and blue continuity wires, the ground wire, and the remote cable are all bundled and tucked away inside the console space, so the harness is intact just in case the next car I put this in requires a longer run.Like many aftermarket head units, my Pioneer has a blue ""system remote"" wire to turn the unit on and off with the ignition (a power antenna lead also works), but I had wondered about tapping into the yellow power wire directly from the HU (as the Kenwood instructions appear to want you to do).  It made more sense finally to run the subwoofer\'s heavier-gauge power line directly to the battery, with the black ground wire attached to one of the seat\'s floor bolts.  To get the wire to the battery, look for a diamond-shaped silicone grommet in the firewall just above the gas pedal.  You can poke a little hole through that and pull the yellow wire through to the battery - it\'s plenty long!  Good metal-to-metal contact for the ground wire is also absolutely essential for the internal amplifier to work.',)"
"('First the good: the remote works well, and is fairly versatile. It can learn any IR device you have, and the online database of ready to go remotes is huge, so if you have lost your old remote, it is probably in the database for you.The form factor is easy to hold and press the buttons with one hand. The keys are back lit, and the full color screen is easy to read.It\'s rechargeable, and the remote cradle helps you keep track of where you left the remote!Now the less than good:A) The remote does not sit solidly in its cradle - you have to wiggle it to make sure it charges. Even the updated cradle after the recall is problematic.B) The setup software leaves MUCH to be desired: UPDATE: Software still is very poor. below is my recent analysis of the poor software:1) You cannot reorder the devices list - it is created in the order you create devices, and that is the order they appear on the remote. If you have more than 8 devices, then some will be on a second page on the remote screen - while it would be preferable to have certain ""hot"" devices on that main screen.2) The database if full of commands that don\'t exist, and that end up on your list of commands for you to delete - and deleting commands, and moving commands around is tedious - in some cases there are 10 pages of ""additional commands"" on the remote to page through - and to delete them and reorder these commands is simply annoying.2b) Database commands frequently don\'t work, and commands that should stream, don\'t stream. (I.e. continuous actuation).3) When you try to create your own device, the software will push a device template on you that may or may not work well.4) You cannot set ""evergreen"" commands. For instance, the volume +- should be work the receiver volume REGARDLESS what device is active. You can only make this happen as an ""activity"", and have to individually program it for each activity.5) In general, the software is a bit clumsy to use - it\'s a Java based app, and therefore does not use the drag and drop functionality of the operating system (Windoze or Mac) - and leaves much to be desired.6) You cannot assign commands to ""stream"" such that when you hold down a button, the command is continuously sent - this is allowed for volume, but for any other command, you have to pay Logitech $29.00 to set a command to stream.A well designed application would allow for drag and drop command arrangement, setting evergreen keys (such as making volume and mute affect the receiver at all times), Assigning the order of devices both on the main device menu, and while a specific activity was active.7) HORRIBLE SUPPORT. Absolutely useless. And if you ask questions on their user forum with even a hint that you may not like a feature, they will delete your account.At vers 7.7 I\'d think it would be a bit more customizable, but they are a long way from an easy to use and highly configurable product.Here are the principal issues:1) General cludgyness: the setup is so terribly long, involved and ""Fisher-Price"" simplified. It is annoying, cumbersome, slow, tedious, and limiting.Specifically, adding and moving custom buttons, navigating through the ""wizards"" and trying to find where you have hidden some particular ""option"" is utterly aggravating.  Seriously, you expect us to guess the difference from ""Settings"" or ""Options"" ??!?! - how unclear can you get?""Customize buttons"" is on the main activities page for activities, but buried in the ""options"" or ""settings"" page for devices. The inconsistency throughout the application is aggravating.2) LACK OF CONTROL: you have designed the remote to function around ""activities"", yet they do not provide full control of activities. WHY? In order to have functions of a certain device available in an activity, then you have to add that device TO the activity.3) CAN\'T REORDER DEVICES (in or not in an activity). Okay, so you want us to program the device around activities - but as noted above, even then you do not have accurate control of devices added to an activity.We need the ability to reorder devices when not in an activity, and reorder them separately if desired for each activity. they way you have it now, the devices move all over the place in seemingly random ways, and when you have more than 8 devices it is INCREDIBLY annoying to hunt and find them in some new location each time.Random device positions? Yea, great idea. NOT. This is a horrid ""feature""!!4) BAD IR COMMAND DATABASE. Okay, here\'s a case of quantity does not equal quality. It seems like every user\'s custom programmed commands get stuck into this database. While this might be an easy way for you to ""grow"" your database, using the database becomes cumbersome at best. Moreover, many commands are mislabeled, or do not function as expected. It seems that mis-named commands get into the database and never get out.Worse, for use users, there is no way to permanently edit the database to suit our particular device. In other words, we\'d like to be able to make our own localized version of a particular device and customize the entire command list - this would not affect your main database, just our remote. This way, everytime we went to adjust the programming of our remote, we wouldn\'t have to scroll through the hundreds of useless commands that do not apply to our device.5) IR COMMAND LEARNING LIMITATIONS. Yes, you can learn new commands. But you have little control over those commands.For instance, on original remotes, some commands will ""stream"" a commands when you hold a button down. With harmony, you seem to be able to do that only with volume. A serious deficiency.The only way to get the remote to stream commands is to PAY customer service ($29.00 as of this writing) to set a command to stream - after spending hundreds on a remote, this is ludicrous. There should be an option to stream any command, but again, tis is left out of the software.6) CAN\'T SAVE SETUPS. Right, so we make a mistake, but after we re-configure, there is no way to ""get back"" to a previous programmed state.7) MUST BE ONLINE. If order to program your remote, you must be online, and you cannot work offline to program or configure the remote. Why? why should I have to be online for a learning remote? You should allow for offline configuration, learning, saving, etc.SUMMARY OF FEATURES THAT ARE NEEDED:For the config software: Put all settings for a device in ONE place, under ONE menu. Stop spreading config pages all over the place.Consistency: Chose one term, ""settings"" OR ""options"" and stick with it. Put related settings in the same relative place throughout the application.Allow for direct settings controls instead of cumbersome wizards.Allow devices in activities to NO CHANGE STATE when entering that activity.Allow device reordering, both outside of activities, and in each activity.Allow deleting IR commands for a device.Allow ""stream"" commands (like volume) but for any command (selection choice).Be able to ""save as"" setups, to store previous configurations.Be able to work offline.Final comment:Seriously, it\'s 2010 - these things should be self evident. It seems instead that Logitech hired programmers that got fired from Microsoft. Poor implementation, and other much more feature rich remotes out there - I am sorry i made this purchase, and I refuse to ever buy another Logitech product. My encounters with the utterly abysmal tech support have left me less than satisfied.',)"
"('I reviewed this product a few months ago right after I bought it and then I went back a month or so later to amend my review and in the process I somehow made the entire review disappear.  So I am writing a new review, and this one is based on several months\' experience with the Harmony 880.First, I have to say that the more I use the Harmony the more disappointed I am.  I have owned, used, and programmed a Pronto TSU200 and a Palm Z22 (using NoviRemote software) before owning the Harmony so I\'m not new to programmable remotes.  I have the patience and savvy to get through the learning curve on these types of things to get the result I want.  The problem with the Harmony is that I have spent that time, learned the remote, but it just doesn\'t work as advertised.I don\'t agree with many who say this remote has an easy to use intuitive interface.  If you have an extremely simple setup and don\'t plan to customize the setup, then maybe the Harmony will work well.  I only have 4 components and I tried to do a little customization with the Activities and it couldn\'t handle that.  The setup interface is OK for the first time you are setting up the remote because it basically holds your hand through the entire process.  Fine - for the first setup.  I read one review where the reviewer called this an ""over-engineered"" setup and I think he hit the nail on the head.  Once you go through the setup the first time and then want to go back to change anything, you have to go through the same laborious process all over again.  Here\'s an example.  I wrote down all the steps in the following process as I went through it to illustrate the sequence exactly.  If your component (device) is not responding correctly and you want to change the number of times the Harmony repeats the IR command it is sending to that device, here is what is involved:You open the Harmony software and it takes you to the website and you log on.  No biggie there.  But, to be able change something like the IR repeat function, you have to know exactly where to go and how to get there.  In this case, you have to select the ""Devices"" tab.  Of course, that brings up all the devices you have set up.  Then there are 3 choices for each device: Settings, Troubleshoot, and Learn IR.  You have to know that you must select Troubleshoot.  When you select Troubleshoot, another screen comes up with 5 options on it.  To get to the IR repeat function, you have to know to select ""Show Me More Problems"".  That brings up another screen with 3 more options on it.  And you have to know that you must select ""Satellite doesn\'t appear to eive every command correctly.""  So another screen pops up with 6 more options and you must select ""The device responds to some commands occasionally"".  That will then bring up the screen where you can select the number of times the IR command is repeated by the remote (0 to 5).After you do all of this, you have to save the configuration and then wait a few minutes while the remote is updated and rebooted.  The thing is that after you do this once and know how to weave through the maze to get to a particular function, like the IR repeat function, that you want, you still have to go through this laborious process each time.  There is no advanced setup that allows you to go directly to these functions, such as IR repeat.  It\'s like there are 10 steps and you know you need to be on step 7 to make the change but the system makes you go through steps 1 through 6 each time.  See spot run. Spot runs very fast.  Now see Spot run again. It ain\'t rocket science but it certainly is annoying and time consuming. Going through this over and over is a nightmare.  Imagine when you are tweaking the remote, as I have been for the past couple of weeks and I have to go through this each time I make a simple change, and then I have to save the change and then update the remote.  Then I have to go downstairs and try the remote to see if the change(s) I made are working.  If it doesn\'t work properly, I have to start at square one.  Call me a looney tune but I hardly see this an intuitive and user friendly.I also have to say that I don\'t agree with many of the users and reviewers who think that having a good pre-programmed code database is a necessity.  I don\'t feel that way.  In fact, I actually prefer to manually learn the remote codes from my original remotes.  That is because I have yet to have a programmable remote that sets up the pre-programmed codes to the buttons and LCD screen the way I want.  There are always more commands set up than the original remote actually has, and on the LCD screens, the more common functions, like Power On, or Power Toggle, are often buried 2 or 3 screens deep.  I find that absurd.  I timed myself the other night and without hurrying, I manually set up my Onkyo a/v receiver remote in the Harmony by using the learning function and it only took three and a half minutes.  So it takes me a lot less time to do it manually and get the commands I want, where I want them on the programmable remote the first time, than if I use the pre-programmed codes and then have to go back and tweak the thing and delete or move commands around to different buttons or screens.  And at less than 5 minutes per remote to do it manually, you can do the math and see that it just isn\'t a big deal.OK, now on to the Harmony itself.  After using it for a few months, I am definitely not a fan of the ""Activities"" based programming.  I prefer a macro setup that I can program to do exactly what I want and I can program any function on any button in any mode.  With the Harmony, you are stuck with the default programming on the hard buttons when it\'s in Device mode.  In Activities mode, it is possible to reprogram the hard buttons, but not in Device mode.  After doing the initial setup on the Harmony, it never could get everything right and when I switched back and forth between activities, I always had to use the ""Help"" function to get everything in sync.  One reason I want a programmable remote is that I don\'t want to have to mess with it once I have it set up.  About a month ago, I got rid of the Sharp TV and the JVC a/v receiver and replaced them with and LCD projector and an Onkyo a/v receiver.  Since doing that the Harmony has failed me miserably.For one, the Harmony just will not turn on the LCD projector when I select the activity I have set up to watch TV.  I have been through and through the web based programming, and nothing works.  When I use the ""Help"" function, it always turns on the LCD projector, so I know the code for the power on function for the projector has been learned correctly in the Harmony.  Also, when I go to Device mode, the projector will power on and off just fine.  I\'ve read the FAQs and Logitech says that if the ""Help"" function cures the problem, then it is a timing issue and I need to adjust the delay of of the IR sending.  I went through the laborious process to do this, many, many times, using delays from 500 ms (default) to 3000 ms.  A 3 second delay is ridiculous but I wanted to see if it worked.  It didn\'t.The Harmony has a similar problem with my Onkyo receiver.  When switching between activities, it sometimes does not go to the correct input on the receiver.  Again, I adjusted the timing of the IR delay, and as I did with my projector as well, I played with the number of times the IR signal is repeated.  None of that works.  As with the projector, the Onkyo responds to commands in Device mode so I know the correct codes are programmed in the Harmony.So I wind up manually turning components on and off and switching to the correct inputs.  I bought this remote so I wouldn\'t have to do that.  Also, the master ""Off"" button at the top of the remote doesn\'t turn off all my components.  I never turns off the projector and it usually does not turn off the Onkyo receiver.To add insult to injury, Logitech has stopped returning my calls.  I""ve sent several e-mails to tech support that have gone unanswered.  I am not a happy customer but I don\'t just vent when I write to them - I explain the problem and how I think the thing should work.  But I guess Logitech isn\'t interested in that and just stopped communicating with me.If you can tell that Logitech has me a little upset, that is absolutely correct.  It\'s bad enough that the product doesn\'t work as advertised, but Logitech won\'t respond to try to solve the problem, and my guess is that is because there is no real solution.  But, this is not an emotional review.  I am not spitting at the screen and pounding the keyboard.  Everything I have written is accurate.I\'ve been doing a lot of research and plan to buy a URC MX-900 or RF30.  Logitech has really dumped on this one.',)"
"('I\'ve owned and used a Harmony 680 for over a year now and have loved it. It was dropped a few times, a couple pieces of the casing have broken off, but it\'s continued to work. But it was time to move it to our secondary TV system and replace it with something newer. Enter the 880.PROS* Includes a rechargable battery. HUGE benefit over my 680.* Includes a tilt-sensor which auto-activates the LCD. This is soooo much better than having to find the ""glow"" button to light up the remote as on my 680.* Has a full-color LCD. Though I personally find the color part fairly useless I enjoy the brighter, more contrasty LCD on the 880 over the 680. You can also upload graphics to use on some screens such as your favorties, etc. Just look online and you can find channel icon packs that include the logos for all the common stations.* Looks professional in appearance.* Has dimples on buttons to help orientate your fingers, useful since the buttons are all similar and in close proximity.* Migrated my current Harmony 680 configuration to my new 880 without any issues. I just told it I now have an 880, updated the remote, and was up and running.* Harmony tech support is outstanding. Easy to reach, short hold times, they always solve any configuration issues I have and seem extremely knowledgable about their products. Very refreshing. I *STRONGLY* suggest anyone having configuration or performance issues to simply phone their support. They can modify configs on their end and all you\'ll have to do is plug-in and update the remote. It\'s like a conceirge service for your remote. They\'re outstanding!CONS* Will indicate battery is charging when in base station even if no battery is physically installed in the remote. Should display ""no battery"" or something similar.* Battery door is EXTREMELY difficult to open. I had to use both hands and extreme pressure. No offense to the ladies but I\'m doubtful my wife or Mom could open the battery door.* Came with NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to properly setup the hardware, it goes straight to installing the softare and configuring the remote. STEP 1) Remove all items from packaging  STEP 2) Install battery  STEP 3) Charge battery overnight by placing remove in base station  STEP 4) So and and so on. I\'ve never seen a product not include SOME sort of printed instructions.* You cannot have a single user profile with multiple remotes in the same profile. You\'re forced to setup multiple profiles for each remote, each requiring it\'s own unique email address and login. I\'m not saying this is a significant issue but it\'s annoying I can\'t have a single site login and manage all my remotes in the same account. I\'m sure it\'s smart enough to know which remote I\'m updating.* Power cable for the base/recharging station is about 12"" too short. I can barely place my base on top of my entertainment center which is where I keep my remotes. I have to keep it at the back right instead of front center due to cord length.* Doesn\'t have a hard button for ""list"" to instantly open the list of recorded shows on my DirecTV Tivo like my 680 does. But it was easy enough to set one of the LCD soft buttons to do that.* I find the play/stop/forward/backward buttons to be placed too far down the remote for comfortable access. It should be closer to the up/down/select ring in the center of the remote like on the 680.* Beyond the intial activity you are required to specifically press the Activities button to locate the list of activities again. This isn\'t critical but I find it much less user friendly than the hard activity buttons found on the 680.',)"
"(""When the LCD screen went out on my Harmony 670, I went to the store to get a replacement.  I decided to go with the more expensive 880 even though admittedly, it was very pricey ($250) retail.  I thought I would be very happy with the upgrade; however, after I got this remote home, I soon realized that more money doesn't always mean a better product.First thing I noticed that the set up was a breeze.  Because I already had my components set up properly with the 670, all I had to do was just upload the configurations to the 880 and I was ready to go without the long initial setup process that I had to do with the 670.  Everything carried over seamlessly and there was no need for me to make any adjustments whatsoever.  It was a pleasant surprise that I did not have to do anything else, but honestly it was kind of what I expected to begin with.  I would have been more surprised if things did not carry over properly.Aside from the peanut design, the remote looks a lot different than the 670.  The only slight similarities are the location of the four way direction pad, the number keys and the custom buttons.  Other than that everything else has been moved around to awkward locations and even the buttons that stayed in relatively the same place have changed their size, and shape.  The first thing I did not like about the remote was the cheap plasticy feel of the buttons and the remote itself; it does not feel like a $250 remote.  Pressing the buttons give a feedback that is similar to that of a child's toy cell phone.  The feel of the remote in my hands felt quite cheap as well and easily breakable.  Worse than the feel of the remote, the button layout leaves a lot to be desired.  Even from someone who doesn't have DirectTV, I found the button layout of the 670 to be near perfect; every button felt to be in the right place which allowed for easy access with your fingers without having to look down all the time.  With the 880, even when you do get used to the key layout, you have to contort your thumb all over the place as you fumble to find the key you want to press.  The volume up and up buttons are so small and so close in proximity to the custom buttons, you may end up pressing the other one instead of what you really wanted to do.  However the worse button layout of the entire controller is the VCR/DVD style buttons, it seems like they were literally thrown on the remote with no thought whatsoever; no intuitiveness at all.  It reminds me of a bad GUI design in a software application where buttons are just thrown together.Even if you can get over the design of the remote, then you must realize that this remote cannot do much more than the 670 in terms of functionality to warrant such a huge jump in retail price.  The only things this remote has that the 670 doesn't is a vibrant color LCD screen with the ability to change your background picture and that it uses a rechargeable battery (similar to a cell phone battery), and comes complete with a battery charger which allows you to charge the battery while its still in the remote.  Oh and the remote displays the battery life as well as the time and date.  Even so, I hardly think that these things warrant a $100 jump in price.  Because I have no problem with using rechargeable AAA batteries for a remote, personally I would have preferred at least an option to use regular batteries instead of being forced to use a battery pack which some people are already reporting problems with.  And the color screen while nice, doesn't really add anything new to the remote functionality wise.  In essence the 670 can do all the things the 880 can at a much cheaper price.I have decided to RMA my 670 to get a new one from Logitech instead of having to buy another one out of pocket.  In all honesty, I think $150 is a little too much to pay for the 670, but if I had to, I would certainly spend that before I spend $250 for the 880.  The 670 is probably the best universal remote I ever owned, and the 880 is probably the most overpriced one I ever owned.  I took the 880 back to the store and got a refund and I will wait for my replacement 670 to arrive. In the meantime I can still use the 670, even though the screen does not work anymore.Functionality wise the 880 still does a great job in consolidating all your remotes into one, and it's still quite simple for it to learn new commands for devices that are not in Logitech's database of devices, the only drawback is the poor design and cheap feel.  Using these two opinions alone, this remote would get 4 stars.  However because the suggested retail is $250, I have no choice but to bump it down to 3 stars since it is quite overpriced.  If you think the color screen and rechargeable battery pack is worth the huge jump in price, and you can get over the poor design, then by all means go for it.  But please don't get ripped off paying for this remote retail, even Amazon is currently having a sale on this remote for much less than the retail price.I still am not about to give up on Harmony remotes, but will stick with the 670 until something better comes along that justifies a jump in price.  For now, I can deal with the black/white LCD screen."",)"
"('At the ~$150 price point that the 880 is now selling at, I would give this product 5 stars.  It\'s not perfect (I\'ll get into the areas of improvement in a bit), but it\'s a very flexible and configurable universal remote.The pros:* Able to replace all the remotes in your system: I was initially skeptical that it could really do this, but it did the job in my case.  In addition to the TV, I have an HD-DVD player, HD tuner, HD-DVR, receiver, CD player, DVD player, DVD recorder, and a VCR.  Even with all of these sources, the Harmony 880 enables me to not have to touch any of the individual remotes* Ability to configure activities: Using the on-line utility, you can configure the exact sequence of keystrokes necessary to switch from one activity to the other.  For instance, using my HD-DVD player, I use the multi-channel input of my receiver, which has to be toggled again to enable switching to another audio source.  I\'ve configured the 880 to toggle multi-channel when I enter the ""Watch HD-DVD"" activity and toggle it again when I exit the activity, freeing up the receiver to receive inputs for the next activity.  You can set up to 8 activities, which is more than some of the lower-end Harmony products.* Ability to set delays on a per device basis: This feature allows you to configure and optimize the remote to the individual IR ""receiving"" characteristics of your component.  Some take longer between consecutive remote commands, some take longer to recover from receiving a command meant for another component.  You\'re able to configure all of these settings to optimize performance of each component in the system.* Charging base: Recharging the remote in the attractive charging base (with cool blue LED-lit symbol) means you never have to replace batteries* On-line Utility: A comprehensive library of supported devices enable you to minimize the amount of 880 to original remote learning (pressing key on your original remote so 880 can ""record"" the IR signal for later use)Room for Improvement:* LCD quality: For this price point, the LCD should have been upgraded by now.  The resolution is fairly low (120 x 160 I believe) and it\'s using CSTN technology (you\'d find this in low end color-display cell phones).  The price of LCD displays has come down significantly and a QCIF+ or QVGA TFT display would look awesome by comparison and enable the slide show feature to have meaning.* Default activity soft-keys: I found the default soft-key options associated with each activity was too small a subset of the full array of keys available on the original remote.  Therefore, for almost all activities, I had to add more keystrokes to support my desired activities.  Easy enough to do, but took extra time.  With more thought, this could have been more seamlessCaveats to take into consideration:* Because the activity macros require multiple keystrokes, you have to hold the remote in front of your system for several seconds in most cases to assure that all commands reach their components.  Otherwise, you\'re stuck in a limbo mode where some components are set, and some non-set.  And because the remote doesn\'t know any better, it can\'t easily recover.  You have to manually correct the components that didn\'t receive their commands to get back ""in sync""* Significant use of soft-keys: Soft-keys are the keys that are labelled on the LCD according to the activities you need.  They are not devoted keys like Play, Menu, etc.  Therefore, you\'ll have to scroll through different pages of soft-keys to find what you need (8 per page).  This makes things less intuitive than the original remote, but ultimately usable.Overall, a great product.  At >$200, I\'d give it 4 stars, but at the current price point, it\'s a 5-star item.',)"
